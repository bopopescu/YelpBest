                I'm unclear on whether this little place, tucked in across a 7-11 on West Bayshore and just a stone's throw from my offices, is related to the bigger and newer Tres Hermanos on University Ave in EPA.  My guess is that they were once related but now are not, based on subtle differences between what is otherwise the same offering at the two restaurants.  Maybe the hermanos had a falling out.  Anyways.  I had the 6 dollar taco plate with carne asada, same as I usually get at Tres Hermanos on University.  Pretty damn good, tough to say which is better.  Pluses: - Tasty - Less greasy than the same plate at TH on University - The side of refried beans was noticeably creamier and better. - In my estimate, you are considerably less likelier to be gunned down in a random act of violence at this quieter establishment.  An acquaintance who is a forensic investigator has told us that TH on University is the only place she has had multiple repeat crime scene visits for gang-related shootings. - Free chips  Minuses: - Some suspect chunks of gristle in my tacos.  Doesn't usually happen at TH on University - No AC - Probably not as tasty overall as TH on University.  So there you have it.  Which is better?  Depends upon your relative weighting of tastier beans vs. tastier carne vs. risk of GSW.
