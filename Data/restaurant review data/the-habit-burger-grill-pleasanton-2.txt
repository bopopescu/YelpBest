                I don't get it.  The Habit was suppose to be the new Juggernaut in the burger world.  There was sooooo much talk about this place coming to the area.  It's ok, not out of this world, waaayyyyyy better than the fast food joints anyday, but not better than in-n-out of five guys.    For the price, I wouldve just gone to Five Guys and get a big giant bag of fries as well.
