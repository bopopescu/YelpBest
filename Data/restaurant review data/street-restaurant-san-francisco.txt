                It is a small place on Polk which is a busy corridor for restaurants and wine bars. I had the fried chicken which was fine. The mash was superb, but overall it was just a mediocre meal. Nothing particular wrong with anything, but not much to write home about either. My foodie friend, Sara, would say, "meh"  Pricing was a little steep considering the quality of the meal. Drinks were hefty but expensive. I would recommend this place if you're local but I would temper expectations.
