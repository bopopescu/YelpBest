                My boyfriend and I absolutely love this place! If we are ever going through fairfield we make a point to stop. Their party platter is huge and has so many different rolls to try, not to mention so affordable. Their bathrooms are in desperate need of some TLC but I'll still give them 5 stars, it's that good.
