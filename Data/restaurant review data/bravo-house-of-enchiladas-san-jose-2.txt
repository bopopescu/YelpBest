                I got the Enchilada michoanas. The enchiladas were just cheese, I'm not sure what kind of cheese it was but I wasn't really feeling it. The chicken on the side had a good flavor and was moist, the potatoes weren't bad. The food is fresh made so a plus for them on that. For right now I will give 3 stars, I will re-review after I try something else.
