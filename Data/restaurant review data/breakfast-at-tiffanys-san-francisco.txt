                Corned beef hash n three eggs big portions... gotta love it... not the original taste but similar that is all I have ever ate here... it feels u up! Too bad it doesnt come with toast. the prices changed 14$ for my meal I think it went up 2 bucks anyway I do recommend this place if you like corn beef hash.
