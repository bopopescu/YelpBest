                So, this was my first time at the new Crawdaddy location. I love the first one but thank God they opened one closer to my house. The crawfish is always on point; they serve it fresh, always. If it's not fresh, they won't sell it at all.   We started off with  1/2 dozen oysters, after, we had a pound of crawfish, a pound of clams and a whole dungeness crab. All were very fresh and delicious, however, a little bit on the salty side.  But it was no problem after our server, Nicole (I believe was her name), took it back to the kitchen for us and fixed the salty problem. Kudos for that.   As for the cocktails, I absolutely loved the hurricane.   Overall, I give it 4.5 stars, (but we'll go ahead and round it up) for a great dining experience.
