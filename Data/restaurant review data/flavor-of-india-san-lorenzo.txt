                I am a little disappointed at the fact that they don't offer dinner buffets. I hadn't tried it before and so my bf and I thought we should give it a try but so much as changed since the summer.  They only offer lunch buffets, and they don't have samosas in their buffets anymore. :-( We came here the other day hoping to try their dinner buffet but ended up ordering some items off their menu. The food was good, but the wait was long. Probably because we ordered so many different things.  But the food was good.  We will definitely return. :-)
