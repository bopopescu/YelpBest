                Most of their locations are in Northern California, but don't worry... there's one in LA!  I thought for how popular this place was, it sure was tiny inside.  There isn't a lot of seating but the tables they have, I like b/c there's a lot of space.    The menu was overwhelming - so many sammies to choose from and all of them sounding good.  It literally took me maybe 5-8 minutes just trying to figure out what to pick.  I went with #24 - Tom Hanks.  It had pastrami, swiss, & bacon.  The sammies are cut in half.  If you check in on Yelp, you get a free bag of chips, but people who didn't still were given free bags of chips.    Sammie price point $9-14
