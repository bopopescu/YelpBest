                Seriously good tacos. I had al pastor and chile verde. Atmosphere is a bit of a hole-in-the wall. Excellent, cheap Mexican cuisine in a taqueria atmosphere - what more is there to say?   This corner used to have 3 AMAZING taquerias (the top 3 in the bay IMHO) until mid 2013 when the city of mountain view took out the building that had 2 of them. It was friggin outstanding Mexican food central. This is the only one that remains, but the new locations for the other two - la bamba and la coste√±a - are both still very very close. I encourage you to try all 3! They're all great - hard to pick between them for which is the best in the bay.   Will definitely be back.
