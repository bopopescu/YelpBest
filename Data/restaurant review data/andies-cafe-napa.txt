                So I didn't know this place was also a drive through, but omg their food is great!!!!! Can't wait to go again. Me and my friend left totally happy and stuffed, the food was awesome and the staff was happy.  

                Random burger shack right next to a car wash off the highway... great find thanks to yelp!  We were staying at a nearby hotel and wanted an early dinner. This place was perfect since it opens until 5 p.m. Nice selection of burgers. Hubby liked his burger and I went with the portabello mushroom burger which was awesome! Great taste and nice toppings. They seemed surprised that I skipped the garlic sauce, so who knows if it would have been even better with it. The onion rings were also delicious and not too greasy.  Service is awesome - huge shout out to the girl who rummaged through their garbage when I accidentally tossed something out there... thank you!!  

                Beep BEEP you can get  delicious Burgers, A Car Wash and More when you go to  Andie's Cafe. I do have to note Andie's Cafe isn't big on ambience. Andie's  doesn't look much fancier and isn't much bigger than a shed you can buy at Home Depot or Lowes. Andie's is a small takeout place that serves breakfast and mostly burgers located in a car wash parking lot.   This time I tried the Andie's Burger. I asked for it to be cooked Medium and it came out Medium Well but still was very juicy and flavorful. They put Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Pickles, Mayo and enough garlic to scare away all the vampires on an Andie Burger. For me the Flour dusted Potato Roll is too big and I'm not a fan of raw flour dusted rolls so I didn't eat most of it but that's just me because I saw everyone else woofing it down.  We got the Frings and that's a basket of Fries with Onion rings they came to us hot and fresh. I liked how crispy they make the onion rings.  Oddly this was the tastiest burger I had in a while.  

                I tried the "safe" sandwich (aka grilled cheese) and not explore the other hamburgers or loaded sandwiches they had to offer.  According to my fiance their cheeseburger was pretty darn tasty minus the overwhelming slather of mayo.  Huge fan of their milkshakes, for sure! Creamy texture and not too thick. I drank up my entire cup before getting my sandwich.    I think its fair to say that I haven't really went beyond to experience what other reviewers raved about. Guess its in the stars to get my hamburger fix when I am back in the area.  

                Came here on. Friday afternoon to get a late lunch while my car was getting washed.  It was my first visit to Andys  and I was really happy with what I recieved.  I ordered the regular cheeseburger and fries.  The cheeseburger was excellent and tasted fresh.  The meat was juicy, the bun was soft without falling apart, there was just the right ammount of condiments and the fries were really hot.  With all of this being said, it was a tad expensive for a burger and fries, over $10.00 and the girl at the register could have been nicer, but it may ha e been a busy day.   I would definitely come back.  

                Went here with my boyfriend after we're done hiking at skyline cuz I was craving for burger and we looked on yelp and saw the reviews are mostly ++. So why not give it a try ^_^  I tried the Dbl Cheesebuger and Frings it was helllaaaaaa good!! Didnt even finish it and bae ordered the Andie's t'was really good too! Definitely will recommend this place!   It's just that the place is just small but it's okay ^___^  

                Not particularly flavorful. Fries are alright assuming the fryer hasn't broken down. Overpriced for what you get. Wouldn't recommend this place. Try Gotts instead.  

                Yummmmy. ...haven't had a burger here in years but will definitely have to make it a point to come back.  

                Found this lil burger joint on yelp! What a find! My kids say we are never eating anywhere else in Napa! Burgers, corn dog and grilled cheese are all delicious. French fries and onion rings are a must! G  

                Want a cheap breakfast? Something quick that you can eat there or take home to eat in the privacy of your Sunday sweatpants? The breakfast bagel (bacon, sausage, egg, cheese on a bagel) is fantastic - and the breakfast burrito is equally mouth watering. PLUS, you don't have to throw down copious amounts of dollars for their food!  

                Andie's never fails to satisfy me. The buns they use are great, and the burgers turn out exceptionally! I am also a big fan of their shakes, and am pretty glad to have found them (thanks yelp). The outdoor seatingis great for cyclists, and are conscious about being sweaty and care about being close to their bikes. Do a ride; earn your Andie's burger.  

                I L-O-V-E this little shack right off the freeway.  I swear you'd think it's part of the car wash, but it's not.  But if you do get a car wash, get a bite to eat .. or two .. or three .. or better yet, stop on in BEFORE you go to the outlets, yes, it's across the street from outlets!    Drive Up Window - yayy But sometimes you can get caught in the cross fire between the cars trying to get there car wash .. If you have a SUV like me .. know how to drive through tight spaces .. because it's tight folks!  Burgers - yayy ALL DAY EVERY DAY (wait don't quote me on business hours, it just sounded good). Wait for it though .. there's more .. it's NOT all meat woman, they cater to the veggie crowd too, yes they do  Milkshakes - yayy  Breakfast - yayy  I would give it a 5 star but the dang parking arrggghhh .. I could bring my lazy ass across the street and park there, and walk to Andie's for a change .. nah .. they have a friggin drive though hahaha #lazygirlstatus #burgersfordays  

                Love the burgers. Love the fries. Love the milkshakes. Love the onion rings. This place is awesome. Be prepared to wait if it's Saturday or Sunday or lunch time. Would give this place 5 stars if the buns were a little sturdier. Best burger in Napa for sure!  

                For a small diner, and I mean small, Andies provides a huge menu with big flavor. I've yet to try everything but love the chicken avocado tacos!  You receive 2 open face corn tortillas withe a large amount of chicken, avocados, lettuce and etc.  Very good!!  

                Yep.  Just as they said.  Expectations from a car wash cafe, pretty low.  But damn good burgers (not greasy,  and very good meat).  Great fries too!   I regret I didn't have room for a shake.  Maybe next time.  Just down the street from the Outlets, and on our way to the Napa and Sonoma wineries, so I can guarantee there WILL be a next time :-)  

                Traditional 1950s style burgers just how you like them fatty!  Eat your weight in grease while you chat with the regulars about how Obama is ruining our country. You deserve it.  

                I literally just finished my breakfast burrito 2 minutes ago. So. Delicious. Those avocados. That bacon. Those hash browns. All perfectly meshed. Fast fulfillment, great quality, reasonably priced.  

                Oh how I wish this place were maybe a bit larger or had a better parking arrangement! Getting to Andie's is a little tough seeing as it's there on the car wash site. There's no real parking save a spot or two street parking. It's a wee shack and you will spend about 10 bucks for a chuck burger and fries, but? It's fresh, fantastic and you can't forget the bacon! Hmmm good burgers. Not much seating here, but a couple tables outside. I guess if you came to get your car washed, it's perfect to just order up while they suds up.   Fresh toppings, hot perfect fries that tasted so fresh they almost made me wanna slap my mama they were so good. Give 'em a try and you'll taste what's easily one of the top two or three burgers in the area. (I personally think they may make the best burger in Napa since Downtown Joe's seemed to change their patties)  

                It not "the best burger" I ordered a Monterey burger, they didn't have any pepper jack cheese, which it was fine so I just got American cheese. Hmm to my Taste the meat didn't taste that whoa, it needed something salt or something. No flavor at all. I waited like 15 minutes to get a hamburger. Don't get me wrong the food it's okay but bad nor good but it's definably not "the best burger."  

                Ask most Napa locals where to find the best burger in town and they will send you here: to a car wash.  The place is tiny, greasy, has absolutely no food ambiance, but will have your hands and face dripping with juicy burger goodness. You can get just about any kind of burger you like.  I have no idea if any of the other menu items are any good because if I'm standing at the counter at Andie's then I want a burger. Preferably with blue cheese, thick bacon, and everything on it.  

                My Husband wanted a Hot Dog and as he was eating, he said "this is pretty darn good"! I had a BLT and fries. We had to wait a little while but the food was hot, fresh and flavorful. I only would have liked my bread not toasted. Solid three and a half...perhaps we'll try the burgers if ever in town again.  

                I can eat at this place all day!! The breakfast burrito is "amazing" and they simply have the best bacon ever!!   Lunchtime I like the chicken tacos, grilled chicken salad and of course the Western Burger.   Note: Try ordering the Crispy Chicken Wrap that's off the menu!! My fav!!  

                Love the burgers here! Yum!! The western burger is a good combination textures and flavors. The bacon is super crispy and the pickles add good tartness to the burger. My patty was cooked slightly over what I ordered, so try to order a bit under what you want. The burgers get pretty messy but they are delicious! The fries are thick cut and the onion rings are pretty massive as well. They charge 25c if you want to get extra ranch dressing.   Yes, Andie's is in the same lot as a car wash, so there aren't too many tables to sit at. We usually park across the street in the lot near the grassy field or close to the outlets. They also have stamp cards so you can get the 11th burger free :)  

                I want to take a moment and update my review. I have visited Andie's Cafe again. The people there really pump out the food and work hard and smile while doing it.  It being right on top of the car wash is interesting. Gives you something to watch as you wait.  I don't eat at fastfood burger joints, so this place is nice for people with burger standards. If you love guacamole don't forget to have some put on your yummy burger! I'll be back there again. (right next to outlet mall, so if you're shopping it's very convenient.)  

                I have a terrible Love/Hate relationship with Andies.  I love Andies because I've eaten the best burger in my life from there, but I hate how long it takes to get said burger into my mouth. I seriously shouldn't complain because I just said that I've eaten the best burger in my life from there.   Take it as a compliment Andies. I continue to subject myself to long waits just so I can increase my waistline.   I'm okay with that and I'd recommend Andies to anyone... and I have!  

                We stopped for burgers today and were incredibly surprised!! The building doesn't scream "amazing burgers sold here", but we had an outstanding lunch. My husband had the chipotle burger. He's an avid grilled and very particular about food. He raved!! I had the turkey burger. It came with freshly sliced avocado, lots of toppings, and a large fresh bun.   Our favorite place in Napa so far!  

                Average burger! It was a rainy day and no customers at the time of my arrival. However the one and only table in the place was absolutely filthy from previous customers. I placed my order and then wiped all the food bits onto the floor. While waiting for my order the dishwasher/cook lady wearing pajama bottoms and purple converse shoes came out from behind the counter and took over the barstool area with a bucket of fries and a large soda. A few minutes later two paying customers entered an placed their order, but had no where to sit. The employee could care less. More focused on yelling to the short butch lady behind the counter in Spanish. The employee never got up after eating, just pulled out her cell phone and started texting. So this is how you treat your customers??? I won't be back!  

                I enjoyed a delicious bleu cheese burger and garlic fries. My friend had the Andy's burger. Both were delicious and juicy. This will be our go to place to eat when visiting Napa!  

                Friendly, quick and delicious. It's a tiny little burger hut using fresh quality ingredients and a simple menu. Parking is limited unless you good across the street and the inside is tiny so watch out for rainy days. If you're heading back from the wineries and need to get your feet and wallet back on the ground, pull of the freeway on 1st St and hit this joint up!  

                This review is for the breakfast burrito....because that is all I have ever had/ever want! My first taste of this amazingness was the bacon burrito.  Unlike any other breakfast burrito in the valley.  A thin, crispy layer of hashed browns, bacon, fried egg, guac, sour cream, salsa, and i think some other stuff.  It was literally like a burrito gone breakfast - as opposed to breakfast gone burrito (if that makes any sense).    Now when I go, I get the veggie burrito - ugh, SO GOOD.  I wish I felt ok getting this every day (if i could i would!)  Although the bacon burrito is hands down the most amazing, I will only order it if I literally am experiencing the worlds worst hangover.   Great spot, I would love to grab a burger here sometime too.  

                Garlic overload!  Purchased an Andie Burger...never again. Staff was great, food was mediocre.  

                Yelp WIN again! BEST BURGERS in NAPA! Their window claim is not folly. On our recent trip up to see my in-laws I craved something a little different than our typical In N Out burger stop.   I saw the reviews on Yelp and we had to try this little burger stop. Full disclosure: The fact that the name of the business is my nickname (actually the name I go by most often) - Andie - did weigh favorably on the final decision. :)   Honestly, this visit could not have been more perfectly aligned in the stars. Andie's Place is a small hut with seating outside, but the day was lovely and warm so it was a welcome change. Also, the patio is dog-friendly so our dog was able to join us and benefit from a taste or two of burger.  The service was SUPER friendly. The fella taking our orders was really enthusiastic and polite. When I told him my name is Andie he was surprised and said "NO WAY!!!" to which I said "way!" :) I got "Andie's Burger" which was pretty much the perfect combo of all things I love.... pickles, grilled onion, avocado, grilled mushrooms! The burger was juicy and flavorful. The fries were fresh and delish. I took a menu with me and learned they use local ingredients... their burgers are delivered daily from a local butcher. Likewise their potato buns, which are like soft fluffy clouds in a perfect blue sky, are also delivered fresh daily from a local baker. I LOVE LOVE LOVE when local businesses source their ingredients locally.  I really wanted to buy a shirt 1) the name and 2) promoting a great place. Alas, they don't sell their shirts, mores the pity!  If you're looking for a place to grab a fantastic burger this is the place. I'd say it's even destination-worthy. I'd easily use it as my anchor and build a day in Napa around the promise of another Andie's Cafe burger.   Oh and a plus for me... they are a Pepsi establishment. I don't often drink soda, but when I have a burger or pizza it just feels right. Our lunch on Saturday was perfection... a fab burger, great fries, wonderful service and a nice ice cold Pepsi to wash it all down.  

                A burger joint at a car wash that will impress. Nice size burger that is cooked and seasoned just right. Usually not crowded with people but boy oh boy they know the recipe to burger goodness. Would I come back yep but only cause I need a car wash.  

                Was wine tasting in napa and stumbled upon this place... This place ROCKS Ordered the Marin burger very tasty and juicy ordered onion rings that was beer battered very tasty..... Nice and very friendly service. Will be back very soon..  Great job guys.  

                Who says you can't get great food at a car wash? A few days ago I inhaled a veggie breakfast burger, with bacon added. Tons of mushrooms, crispy hash browns, peppers, egg and of course bacon. Each bite was amazing goodness, so if you are looking for a hearty breakfast or a hangover cure, this is a great place.  I've also enjoyed the bacon cheese burger (notice the bacon trend?), which was juicy and prepared at a medium temperature, just the way I like my burger. The ingredients are fresh, I.e. the lettuce crisp and the bacon with the right amount of grease.  So next time you are shopping at the outlets, skip the food court and walk across the street to Andie's Cafe.  

                Chuckburger is served on a potato bun.  Good stuff. Also their breakfast burritos are really good too.  For me, there are many factors that play into a food/restaurant experience.  Food, service, environment, price to name some measurable things. In its own way, Andie's has it all.  Andie's to me is one of those places where two unlikely combinations of business go really well together. I don't know if the car wash and the restaurant are samely owned, but what a nice marriage it is. If you dig deeper into to the more everyday parts of Napa, not so much the "ooh ahh Wine Country" aspect, you'll find some really good people and some really good food.  You will also find other combination businesses like the local liquor store(s) that sells spaghetti in meat sauce and "their" famous Malfatti's (just yelp the word, you will likely find what I'm talking about.)  I've been here a few times. Each time I go get my car detailed, I come here. The car wash folks do a good (not super great- good.) wash and wax, while I kick back and have a meal.  Keep in mind that you have your car to pick up still. DH and I have to double team it. I put the order in and wait at the burger seating area, and he goes thru the mini mart, pays for the detail and waits for the car to be done. By the time he comes back, the food is ready and we have ourselves a hot meal.   Takes about 15-20 min for the food to be ready. They're busy and folks are using their little drive thru to pick up stuff all the time.   The people watching, the great food, a clean car, easy parking, awesome condiments, service with a smile. No complaints here at all.  Welcome to Napa.  

                Yummy Veggie Burrito Def great place for a breakfast burrito! Will be going back for sure!  

                You can nevergo wrong with Andies. I always have the garden burger, its do die for! & the onion rings are pretty good too!!  

                A dinky burger place smack-dab in the middle of  a car-wash in the heart of wine country. Yup, this place is absolutely legit.   A Yelp search for a quick and casual lunch spot to hit up on a Sunday in between wine tastings led us to Andie's. If you don't want to do the drive-thru (or get your car washed) there's a parking lot across the street, but you feel kind of like Frogger trying to get across the street (so be careful!). Don't drink and jay-walk!  The burger here is really good. I got the Andie's Burger (~$7.67) which featured grilled mushrooms, jack cheese, and a kick-ass garlic sauce. It's the garlic sauce that really gives this burger a unique flavor that distinguishes itself from burgers from other joints. The patty itself was juicy, although a bit over-done for my taste (they never asked how I wanted the patty cooked, guess I should've been more proactive about that). It might get messy towards the end, but they do a good job  wrapping the burger to prevent any freak sauce/juice dripping on yourself.   There's no real indoor seating, but while in Napa you might as well enjoy the sunshine while feasting on some tasty burgers. Watching cars getting cleaned 5 feet away while you eat just adds to the coolness factor of this place.  

                Yummy burgers and fries. One of the best places to eat -next to the Napa Outlets. I'm glad I found this place through Yelp, because the outlets didn't have a dining option. Super tiny, right next to a car wash, but has a loyal following.
