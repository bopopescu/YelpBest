                Restaurant website hours listed this as opening at 12 on new years day. When we arrived, the sign in the window said 4 p.m. My disappointment can not be overstated. I was told this was a fantastic place to get a burger. When I called the previous day I was told the establishment would open at 12.   I will not be returning as the disinformation has turned me off on attempting to eat here in the future.
