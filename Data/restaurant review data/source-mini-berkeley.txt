                I'm not vegan.  Like, I'm really not vegan.  It's very rare that I have a meal that's without some kind of meat.  BUT, I would tear into a Gilroy with gluten-free wrap and fries over a burger any day.  Seriously.  Also, rosemary sea salt fries.  What?!  Staff is super friendly and are really knowledgable about what's in the food.  They're a great addition to the gourmet ghetto.
