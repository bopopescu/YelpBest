                Love the employees! Always friendly, and they work very efficiently and care about getting a long line dealt with efficiently (unlike Stuffed Inn across the street, which has much longer and slower lines).  Plenty of great vegetarian sandwiches- veggie delight, hummus, and the falafel are my favorites.
