                I can't believe I never went here while I was in school, a whole FOUR years that I could have been spending a small fortune on this gourmet ghetto spot!  The menu changes pretty often, so hard to recommend anything in particular because it may not be on the menu when you try it... Well, other than the famous potato puffs, just get them!  Honestly, you CANNOT go wrong here, I have been several times now since my first time and I have tried different items and they have all been fantastic. I am totally wishing I was writing this from Berkeley, so I could go grab whatever delicious sandwich is on the menu!  From now on, anytime I am remotely close to Berkeley, I will be making a stop at Gregoire for whatever is on the menu ;)  MY GO-TO: Like I said, you can't go wrong here. Get whatever sounds good to you and you will be amazed at how much better it tastes than you even thought it would!
