                My favorite Chinese restaurants closed Mondays do I came in to try this out. I was surprised. I grabbed a single dinner. Egg flour soup is my new favorite. The egg rolls and prawns where great!!! The Mongolian beef was super good. Very filling. Price was cool to being that I got a lot of food.
