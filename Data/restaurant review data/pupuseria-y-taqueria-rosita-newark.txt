                My wife is salvadorean and Mexican. I've never tried salvadorean food until I met her. We've searched all over for places to eat, usually finding spots in San Jose or nowhere near home. Low and behold, a spot literally down the block!!!! Â Where has this piece of heaven been all my Newark life?!?!   Holy smokes! Pupusas are bomb!!! I picked up some tamales de elote (corn tamales) like my great grandma used to make! I'm in love!
