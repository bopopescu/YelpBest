                Came out to the city for brunch with some friends and one of them suggested Kitchen Story. I promptly accepted, especially tempted by one Deep Fried Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast. I also ordered the Pumpkin Spiced Chai.  Pros:   + I'm told 30-35 minutes is a relatively short wait time for brunch on a Saturday Morning. I'm not a regular bruncher so I cannot confirm. + Line moved fairly quickly.  + Food came out promptly and the presentation, with 2-3 fried pieces of spaghetti, was nice  + Tables were adequately spaced out - no spillages, awkward elbow rubs, etc.  + The actual food portions were huge. And that mascarpone deep fried toast was phenomenal.  + Things were expensive. $5 for a hot drink?!?  Cons:  - No vegan options and highly limited eggless/vegetarian options.  - The service was ok - they took our requests but there was no above and beyond type of service. It's freaking cold in San Francisco, maybe put out a heater for everyone waiting. Getting drinks while we waited involved waiting forever for the server to not look so harried and actually listen to what we wanted.  - The Pumpkin spiced chai tasted like oatmeal and water broth with a hint of cinnamon. It was fucking cold so I drank it up but at $5, not sure if I'll ever order that again.  - Raspberry lemonade is quiet nice.  - Rainbow potatoes are yummy and satisfying - not worth $5 though.   Not sure if this place really satisfies my specific brunch needs, but I'd certainly recommend it to others looking for short wait times.
