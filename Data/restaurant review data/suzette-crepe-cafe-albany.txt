                Despite all the wonderful reviews and the local hype, my huband and I were squarely not impressed. We finally ended up dining here after three attempts to "grab food from here" when in a mild hurry. The first two times we ended up canceling our order because waiting 20+ minutes for two crepes was not within our time budget. Finally, trial #3, we ended up waiting out the total 30 minutes it took for us to receive our 2 dessert crepes and 1 savory crepe.  The bill was only $15 total, which was extremely reasonable given what we ordered. The amount of time it took for us to receive our food, however, was not quite so reasonable; perhaps it's because there were only two places on the oven to make crepes, but for a full house (Sunday brunch) of over 40 patrons, most of whom are families of small children, I don't think 2 oven slots is quite enough. Probably a good problem to have. :)  The crepes themselves? Had better. I like the thin buckwheat and whole wheat options. Too bad the insides (peanut butter for one; spinach egg mushroom for the other; and cinnamon sugar to end) were rather skimpy and flavorless: not sweet enough, not salty enough, and quite dry overall.  I will say, though, the cashier and waitstaff were very chipper and friendly. A+ for attitude and for having budget vegetarian options.
