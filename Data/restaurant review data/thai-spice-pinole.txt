                Great food, but slow service. The pad thai and fresh spring rolls are good. The peanut sauce is light and tasty. I highly recommend the ped yang, which is roast duck with a vibrant lime chili sauce. I would definitely come back to have this dish again. However, the service was very slow, and our entrees came at different times. We had to wait a while between courses. I think this is a great place if you want to have a long conversation catching up with friends or family.
