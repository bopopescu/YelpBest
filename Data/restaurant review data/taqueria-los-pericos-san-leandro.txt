                Studying by the San Leandro library? Looking for a quick bite?  Come give TLP a shot! Their super burritos are huge and filled with meat! I came here around lunchtime, there was no line but a lot of seats were taken. I like how you order first and then get a number to sit good when eating with friends so you can pay for your own meal. I got the super steak burrito with no bean and no cheese. They use american cheese, so I didn't want the cheese to overpower the meat. Total was about 9 something.   It was a little bit more than I would usually pay for a burrito, but the portions are great. Will I be coming back? Only if I am studying in the area and crave mexican food. There is a burrito truck next to my house that is delicious as well for a cheaper price.
