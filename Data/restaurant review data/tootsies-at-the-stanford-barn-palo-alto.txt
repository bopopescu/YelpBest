                The 4 star rating was definitely deceptive. We were in the area and searched up a decent place for breakfast, per Yelp. What should have been a more exhaustive Yelp search led us here so now we've learned our lesson.  The place is this cute hipstery barn, which is nice and all but it doesn't make up for their abysmally small breakfast menu (which, mind you, is not accurate or up-to-date, both of which make for a frustrating ordering experience). You might think, oh well, less is more, but when leaving seems like just as good as any other option, something's kind of wrong with the menu.   Anyway we settled on some egg scrambles. They were pretty flavorless. Could have done it myself with 2 eggs and some kale. Tried to make these plain Jane eggs more interesting with some Tabasco or ANYTHING but none were to be found here (trust that I definitely asked).   For $5 ish per dish you could say that I shouldn't complain. However I had one very hungry stomach to fill that morning and could have filled it with anything in Palo Alto, so I was just bummed that Yelp landed me here when what it should have said was, "Go here if you're on a budget and want something fast, but otherwise the food is not interesting."
