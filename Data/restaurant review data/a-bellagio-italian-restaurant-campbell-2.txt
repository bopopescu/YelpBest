                I had really hoped A Bellagio would live up to the 5-star rating I previously gave 6 years ago. I'm not sure if it's because Lorenzo wasn't there greeting us with 'bella!', or because the food wasn't as good. Or maybe it had something to do with the fact that we were not sent off dancing into the night with limoncello shots.  AMBIANCE (3 stars): ---------------------------- To start off, we were seated in the covered outdoor area -AKA- Section Rejected, which was way less picturesque than inside the restaurant itself. This was disappointing as it definitely detracted from the overall dining experience. Families with loud children, people having questionable discussions that bordered on racist remarks, and a taunting view of the way more beautiful interior were the key highlights.  FOOD (3.5 stars): ------------------------ Maybe I just didn't order the right thing. Because of my dairy allergy I tried to avoid the rich, cheesy dishes, which severely limits my options. I was craving risotto, but really wanted scallops. The server said she could add scallops to the Salmon Risotto. I was dubious about the combination, but decided to give it a try since servers often know best.   My initial gut feeling was correct. While it tasted good on the first several bites, it became overwhelming after awhile. The salmon was super fishy and there was so much of it in the risotto -- with too great a proportion -- that it overpowered my beloved scallops. The dish was rather expensive at $28 ($21 for the salmon risotto + $7 to add scallops), although $7 for three ginormous scallops is a considerably good deal.  SERVICE (4 stars): -------------------------- Consistently and friendly. Our server did a great job despite having to wait on the tables in Section Rejected.  OVERALL: 3.5 stars. Sadly, this place is now just average. There are many good Italian places out there with more reasonable prices.  DATE TIP: Insist on sitting inside, where it's much more romantic. And those limoncello shots are sure to make your date happy!
