                Pappardelle all'Aragosta! Come to this restaurant and order that dish if you feel like loving yourself a bit extra tonight. It's the lobster pasta- made of creamy, cheesy, tomato sauce that smothers thick, wide noodles with chunks of delicious lobster throughout. The presentation of the dish is adorable as it's garnished with the clean shell of your cooked lobster. I like that they thought to garnish the plate with the shell, yet did the hard work for you beforehand altogether. The hard work being shelling the lobster and chopping it into bite size pieces for you. All that is left for you to do is to simply eat the dish, enjoy it, and feel spoiled.   The ambiance and decor is described by me as rustic romance. This restaurant is specifically nice for date night because of this.   Oh, service is wonderful! I love the host and servers. I've been here 3 times already, and everyone has been consistently charming. I've been pleasantly catered to by various gentlemen here, all always checking to make sure my dining experience is the best it can be. I really appreciate that.   It's easy to confirm that I'll be a regular at A Bellagio. I love the place, people, and plates.   Random last notes: - Calamari is good. - Fettucine Verdi Bolognese is currently my second favorite dish.  - Chardonnay selection is decent.  - Pappardelle all'Aragosta was honestly SO good that I couldn't wait to get hungry again to eat the leftovers later.  

                I would only give them 3.5 stars but rounding up since we did go with a large party of 16.  Appetizers were delicious. Carpaccio and caprese salad were both yummy picks and good items to share.   The minestrone soup was good - packed with tons of fresh ingredients and quite filling.   I ordered the pasta carbonara as my main course. It was just okay, likely would not order it again.   The service was super slow. Took forever to get menus, main courses took 1 hour to be served and we had to ask multiple times for drink refills. They may have been short staffed because I only saw 2 waiters. Our waiter brought out the main courses two at a time for 16 people...  

                My Friday dinner order-  Caprese salad, minestrone, Panzarroti al Forno.   Taste- Panzarroti Forno was a bomb, I had never  tasted anything like that before. It was fresh crepe filled with ricotta, parmesan, spinach baked tomato cream sauce. This place is vegetarian friendly.  Ambience- Romantic. Friendly staff. Service was pretty quick.   Cost- Dinner for two costed  ~$45!   Definitely, worth a try!  

                Be warned: this place doesn't serve any Pizza like most Italian places do, but that's totally fine as they do their pasta dishes really well.   In fact, there is a good amount of various pasta dishes you can choose from, including several vegetarian ones, and all we tried so far was really tasty. Their sauces have great flavor and are not too heavy.   There's always a special of the day which changes regularly. In addition to the pasta they also serve meat dishes - they taste really good and fresh too. Wine list is solid too.   Service is friendly and brings that Italian charm and vibe. Really enjoy the place!  

                Amazing service and food osso buco is the traditional set with polenta Large wine list Great for a romantic dinner  

                Absolutely fantastic meal...and the whole menu is mouth-watering. The one downfall is the available wines by the glass aren't the greatest - don't do the amazing food justice. The bottle list is terrific, but the I'd like to see a couple better by the glass options. But I'm happy to overlook that for the great food and ambience!  

                Wifey  and I came here for dinner a few weeks ago.   It was around 9 in the evening so it was a bit later than most people eat.   But to make a long story short, they nailed it.     The service was spot on, our waitress had the timing spot on.   The highlight of the evening was the dinner.   They nailed it.   Everything was so good, I had pasta and wifey had fish, we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals.   In fact, it was so good, we ended up ordering some dessert.   The tiramisu was awesome.     Well done folks.   Will I be back?  Sure, the next time I'm in the area.  

                I love A Bellagio! It doesn't have as many options as a lot of Italian restaurants but there is a reason for that. Everything they do make here is INCREDIBLE!! I have 2 favorite meals, the Gorgonzola gnocchi and the  bucatini Bellagio. My wife loves the chicken and the Osso Buco. All very authentic, and flavorful. I love coming here.  

                Quite disappointed. Reviews raved how great it was. Aside from the wine, the rest was certainly not up to par. Our server (a nice enough gent) was absent most of the evening.  For such a small restaurant and such a number of staff, one would be inclined to think they could at least look up for a moment and see if anyone in their area needed anything.  The appetizer, shrimp wrapped in priscutto, seemed ok. The bread was grainy and I figure it was something similar to what would be served in a Italy.     Everything just took forever!!!  The main course... You swear they butchered the beef that evening. Now, I ordered my steak medium rare. It came( after an hour) with tongue burning potatoes and broccoli... And a seated steak ICE COLD in the middle.   We were forced another glass of wine which I didn't want.   For $150, it was NOT worth it.  I accept they have had a bad night, but when I'm paying, there's no excuse.  Just not a good experience.  

                My boyfriend and I went here for a Christmas dinner (so this review is long overdue) and it was fancy enough for us to have a classy meal, but not too uptight where we felt stifled. The waiter was extremely attentive and knew the menu very well so she gave us good recommendations. While the pastas were really good, the one thing that really won me over was the Tiramisu. DELICIOUS. For authentic Italian food, this is certainly a place you don't want to miss.  

                We went here for the first time on 3/21 to celebrate my Moms birthday. I can't say enough good things about this place  it was a wonderful experience from the time I called for a reservation until we waked out the door   The place is beautiful and not too loud so you can carry on a conversation   The staff was AMAZING nothing was a problem no matter what I asked for   So friendly and professional   The food was OUTSTANDING we ordered off the banquet menu and every dish was DELICIOUS!!!!  The desserts WONDERFUL!!  They packed up all the leftovers which was a wonderful surprise and they were just as delicious the next day   I will DEFINITELY be back for dinner and we plan to do more celebrations there  I can't recommend this place enough   Thank you  A Bellagio for a wonderful evening!!'  

                Loved it! I went there with my girlfriends and I was very pleased. Everybody were very nice and the food was amazing!!! I will definitely recommend it and come back!  

                Absolutely fantastic! Everything was ON POINT I have been here 6 times already and always have a wonderful experience. I particularly love the bread and the Pappardelle all'Aragosta is my fave!  

                My husband and I dined here and were disappointed in our dinner.  He had spaghetti carbonara, which he found bland.  I had the sea bass special, which was just so-so.  The service was a big problem when my entree came out before we finished our appetizer.  The server did replace it and the manager offered us a complimentary dessert but we will not return there.  

                This place is beautiful - food is out of this world good  and the service is the best I have ever experienced. We were so thrilled to try out this place- and I am so surprised we hadn't ever ventured in before. If you love Italian food you will not be disappointed - the gnocchi and the clams were insanely good. We are big fans!!  

                Perfect place for a date! Though be ready to pony up the dough because this place isn't cheap.   They've got both indoor and outdoor seating - they crank the AC here so it's probably better to sit outside if you're sensitive to the cold.   The food and service here is great - pasta is cooked El dente but you can tell you're server what kind of texture you prefer so that the chef can prepare it accordingly.   I really wish this place had a special dip for their bread, though. Like some kind of garlic mixed with pesto and olive oil or something instead of the standard olive oil and balsamic vinegrette. So this is definitely something this restaurant can one up their game on - hence the four stars.   Anyways, for starters the bf got prosciutto wrapped grilled prawns and it was excellent! The prawns were juicy and fairly sized and the sauce had a hint of tart with capers. You can go wrong with this appetizer and it was one of the specials of the night.   Speaking of daily specials, you really can't go wrong with any of the specials. The bf and I ordered 2/3 dishes that were specials of the night and they were both delicious. He ordered the diced filet mignon with onions and mushrooms which was one of the entree specials for the night. I ordered the pasta al sliccicia (I'm sure I slaughtered the spelling on that one), which was a penne pasta with sausage and sundried tomatoes, a dish that many people order typically. It was great and flavorful but I would recommend sticking with the specials if you really want your taste buds to be wowed.   Definitely a notable favorite whenever I'm craving Italian. Which is actually quite often....  

                Went here again last night with the bf. Another great dinner at A Bellagio. I'm seriously obsessed with the gnocchi here, I need to start trying other entrees but why mess with a classic? Also got the caprese salad to start. I had two lemon drop martinis and the bf drank rum and cokes. Will be back again!  

                Always looking for superb Italian restaurants. Bellagio is that. Wonderful menu choices plus specials. Took a while to narrow my selection so many dishes sounded delicious.  I chose the veal saltimboca and the house salad. My husband had the lobster ravioli special and minestrone. Both were delicious!  This is definitely on our favorites list. Enjoy!  

                So many things that make this restaurant a star in Campbell!   First of all, the food. I'm very picky when it comes to Italian cuisine and every dish I've had here has been nothing short of spectacular. The true test? The carbonara. Oohhh the carbonara! One of the few places that actually makes it correctly. For those of you who share a love for this dish (adult version of macaroni and cheese), this place makes the sauce out of egg and parmesan, unlike those awful other places who take fettuccine alfredo and add black pepper and call it 'carbonara'.  Next, the wonderful people who work there. Coming here feels like coming home for dinner. Everyone there is so nice and work so hard to make sure that you have the best experience possible.  Third, the secret --- the amazing bartender! Yasha is an alchemist when it comes to mixing drinks! He is one of the few people I've found that can make a cosmo correctly. Not to mention the great drinks he creates like his basil martini! He works there Friday and Saturday - highly recommending going one of these nights if you're picky like me and like amazing cocktails.   Oh yeah, to top it all off? They make their limoncello in house. Another must try!  

                My husband took me there for my birthday. Had I heard what the man said to my husband just before he seated us I would have left right then and there.  My husband ignored it because he didn't want to spoil my birthday. The man who seated us was annoyed because we did not have a reservation and he said to my husband "well I can get you in but I hope you can eat fast" It was early and no one was there. Had I heard that I would have left.  The food was not good at all and the meal was $100 dollars.  I will never go there again.  

                If you come for lunch on a workday, no one's there so you get faster service and more attention, and the food is cheaper! I ordered the special of the day, and I think it was $18. The rest of the menu seemed to be $13-16, which isn't bad for Italian.  I ordered the basa, which was the special. The first few bites were pretty good and unique, but then I realized I wasn't very used to the white wine sauce, and it got a little old. I didn't quite want to finish. The broccoli and potatoes were cooked well though! Also, the portions vary by quite a bit from dish to dish... I went with a couple friends, and we noticed the spaghetti allo scoglio had a lot more than my basa or the ravioli. Luckily my appetite wasn't that big, so my basa was enough for me.  Server was nice and extremely friendly. She told us stories while we were eating, and maybe if we weren't in a rush to get back to work we would have appreciated it more. She made a few mistakes, but was super nice about it.  

                A delicious celebratory meal.   Took my parents here for a special celebration. My parents are italian foodies so I knew I was taking a bit of a risk. Bellagio delivered!   The service was fantastic, a cozy space with an excellent wine menu and they carry my favorite Moscato. We were a mix of veg and non-veg as well as a child and they were able to please all palettes.   My favorite was the fresh crepe. A-MA-ZING. If you are a vegetarian I strongly suggest this dish for it's complex flavor. It's filling but light to the taste. My dad did the Saltimbocca and was thrilled since it was something he hadn't ventured to try before.  Overall an excellent place to dine with friends or family for when you want something delicious and satisfying that pleases a variety of palettes.  

                Nice ambience! Ordered calamari, prawns for appetizer. Was great. Not spongee or elastic. Crunchie that also melts in your mouth. Spaghetti with clams and prawns was excellent!   Service wonderful. Definitely recommend  

                Maybe it's because I loaded up on bread before my meal, but the pasta was a letdown. I got the lobster pasta--don't ask me what it's called because I can't even pronounce it, let alone spell it. The lobster was very flavorful, but unfortunately sparse. The noodles had a fresh pressed homemade feel to it. The thing I didn't like was that the entire dish lacked flavor. This is probably personal preference, but I'm used to the sauce smothered stuff at Olive Garden. The pasta here definitely tastes more authentically Italian, but it's just not for me.  My friend got the Bucatini Bellagio pasta--which had parma ham and egg yolk in it. Although flavorful, the pasta was extremely raw and chewy/hard.   They brought out a slice of tiramisu for my friend's birthday, and it was enough for 7 girls to share. SO MOIST. SO DELICIOUS. Highlight of the meal.  The best part was the service. 5 stars for our gracious waitress who was cheerful and willing to accomodate our every need. And the servers who refilled our glasses of water every 2 minutes and spoon fed my friend the tiramisu---it was unexpected and awkward but soo funny!!! Since the price is quite steep, I probably won't be coming back... but the staff made it an extremely positive experience. :)  

                I've been to this restaurant multiple times now and each time the food has amazing! Service is great, ambience is perfect, pasta is fresh and made from scratch! Prices are reasonable as well! This is a great place for Italian eating! Make sure you have a reservation!  

                When we walked in the guy in the front asked us if we had a reservation and we said no at which point he took our name down. There weren't any pleasantries and he didn't let us know how long the wait would be so that was a bit odd. We waited for about 15 minutes and were seated.   Our server was attentive, but he didn't go out of his way to let us know what kind of vegetarian options were on the menu. We ended up ordering two pasta dishes, a couple of glasses of wine and tiramisu for dessert.   The wine and the tiramisu were delicious, but the stars of the show (our pastas) were under-cooked! The pasta was premature of al dente and just weird in consistency. If they had only cooked the pasta a few minutes longer our dishes would have been delicious.  

                Simply a beautiful restaurant with amazing and friendly staff. I have never met a waitress in my life that genuinely is happy to see us and becomes more than a waitress but a friend at the moment.   So sad that I forgot her name! :-(  Their menu items is a little pricey but the quality of their food is much better than  what you'll pay for at Cheesecake Factory which makes it worth every penny.   Another restaurant with a romantic atmosphere to take your significant other for a date :-)  

                Very cozy spot with great food and service!  

                This used to be my favorite italian place.  Not anymore.  Last time I was there, I had called in advance for reservations and the owner(?) told me to just come on in, no problem.  When I got there, restaurant seemed empty but when I asked for a table, he told me they were all full.  Perhaps they are not kid friendly as I had my kids with me.  When I told him that I called and he told me to come on in, he said "oh that was you?"  Then he told me that we needed to eat fast.  Seriously?!?  Wow!  Poor service and manners!    Didn't really enjoy our meal that evening either.  This will most likely be the last place we will go to for italian as there are a lot more italian restaurants out there to chose from.  

                I had the lobster pappardelle and it was absolute heaven. I tried a bite of my friend's Gorgonzola gnocchi and it was so rich and delicious. We shared a burrata cheese appetizer that was wonderful. To top it off our server was nice, charming, and unbelievably helpful. Whenever I'm back in San Jose, I'm definitely coming back.  

                The food and atmosphere is fantastic! It is listed as casual, but there were a lot of drees folks! The staff is awesome, but that may just be ours for the night, if you can ask for Abbas, he's wonderful! OMG ask for Abbas, he's been better than wonderful...He's Incredible and so very meticulous! We felt pampered and at home, drinks never dry!  We had the following:  Frito misto Ceasar salad Gnocchi gorgonzola Osso buco  I recommend ALL of it!!  

                Always a treat.  We have decided this is our go-to Italian restaurant. My hubby has a lobster pasta that was delicious.  I had the special rigatoni with filet mignon.  All I can say is whoa!  The meat was accompanied with a rich sauce with mushrooms that was amazing. Service was great!  BJ was a super server! And I almost forgot to mention the buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto, tomatoes, & basil as our appetizer. Everything was simply spot on! Bravo!  

                My guest and I went here on November 25th for her Pre-Birthday Birthday dinner. Started off with a bottle of Superfecta [from the Seabiscuit Ranch], Delicious! I think we went through two bottles. Their food was really good and very well seasoned. What I liked the most about this place is their service and ambiance.  Will be definitely returning!  

                Best restaurant in Campbell! :) I've come here so many times and it's a great experience each time. The food is great and a beautiful atmosphere!  

                I called to make reservations for a birthday party and the man I spoke with seemed like he wasn't interested  at all.  He didn't ask any questions he was very quick and hard to talk to you.  The restaurant was okay the food was ok and the service was okay.  Does not really cater to children which was a big concern for me. After all Italian restaurants should have Italian hospitality.  This restaurant did not have any hospitality at all. We won't be going back.  

                Pasta was very salty and too much sauce- had to send back- hadn't been here for a long time and now I remember why.  

                Again, great service, great food. I usually get the Insalata Di Mire, always a good choice. Thought I would change it up. I ordered the Cacciucco alla Livornese, (Ciopino) excellent!  

                Gorgonzola gnocchi. The sauce is deliciously cheesy, creamy, and rich. The gnocchi itself is soft and pillow-y. It kind of melts in your mouth in this savory way that makes you feel so satisfied. I was pretty hungry before I came here, and only managed to make it half way through my plate of gnocchi. I could have eaten the entire portion, but I knew I would seriously regret it later, especially because I was wearing a dress that was tight across the abdomen. Eating the entire plate of gnocchi would have meant a seriously bulging stomach.  The complimentary bread in the beginning was also quite good -- the rolls were soft, perfect for soaking up the olive oil and balsamic vinegar mix we made at our table.  The service was good, the restaurant was cute. A nice ambiance for a date, but would also work for family gatherings or dinner with friends. Ill be back for more gnocchi.  

                Nice place to get some italian  My wife and I went there for my birthday dinner since it was fairly late. The restaurant was mostly empty and we were promptly seated. Our waiter was very friendly and explained the specials of the day. My wife went there specifically with linguini and clam in mind while I wanted to have some seafood.   The bread they provided was good and fresh and since we were hungry, I ate quite a bit. The antipasti plate had several meat variety which all tasted good but I wished there were some more cheese and pickles.   I have to say I forgot the name of my dish but I was hoping that it came with some pasta, instead it was more like a bouillabaisse. It was pretty tasty and the portion was appropriate, if it had some pasta then it would be too much.   We were quite full and the waitress brought out a complimentary tiramisu cake. It was very moist but lacked a bit of liqueur. Overall it was a good experience and looking forward to coming back.  

                I had really hoped A Bellagio would live up to the 5-star rating I previously gave 6 years ago. I'm not sure if it's because Lorenzo wasn't there greeting us with 'bella!', or because the food wasn't as good. Or maybe it had something to do with the fact that we were not sent off dancing into the night with limoncello shots.  AMBIANCE (3 stars): ---------------------------- To start off, we were seated in the covered outdoor area -AKA- Section Rejected, which was way less picturesque than inside the restaurant itself. This was disappointing as it definitely detracted from the overall dining experience. Families with loud children, people having questionable discussions that bordered on racist remarks, and a taunting view of the way more beautiful interior were the key highlights.  FOOD (3.5 stars): ------------------------ Maybe I just didn't order the right thing. Because of my dairy allergy I tried to avoid the rich, cheesy dishes, which severely limits my options. I was craving risotto, but really wanted scallops. The server said she could add scallops to the Salmon Risotto. I was dubious about the combination, but decided to give it a try since servers often know best.   My initial gut feeling was correct. While it tasted good on the first several bites, it became overwhelming after awhile. The salmon was super fishy and there was so much of it in the risotto -- with too great a proportion -- that it overpowered my beloved scallops. The dish was rather expensive at $28 ($21 for the salmon risotto + $7 to add scallops), although $7 for three ginormous scallops is a considerably good deal.  SERVICE (4 stars): -------------------------- Consistently and friendly. Our server did a great job despite having to wait on the tables in Section Rejected.  OVERALL: 3.5 stars. Sadly, this place is now just average. There are many good Italian places out there with more reasonable prices.  DATE TIP: Insist on sitting inside, where it's much more romantic. And those limoncello shots are sure to make your date happy!
