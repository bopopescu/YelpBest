                I was super skeptical when my friends and I first sat down and examined the menu because restaurants that attempt to serve food from multiple countries (in this case, Chinese and Japanese) tend to be terrible. We ended up ordering a few Chinese family style dishes and rice in addition to two sushi rolls.  The food was great! It came out quickly too. As we were eating, we looked through Yelp reviews and saw multiple pictures of an interesting dish so we asked what it was and learned that it was seaweed/fried fish. Later, as we were enjoying our food, a worker brought out that dish we had asked about and it was on the house! I reaaallly liked it. Never saw that dish anywhere else before.  The servers were super friendly and brought us a plate of watermelon and grapes, tons of fortune cookies and lollipops, and 4 boxes of apples after we finished our food, all on the house.  Overall, we had a great experience and I'd definitely come back when I'm in the area.
