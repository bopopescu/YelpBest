                I just went back to this place for a little birthday delight.. All I have to say is...say hello to the bartender. HHe like when people sit at his bar!  The ladies and I did just that prior to eating upstairs.  I must warn, this man makes a mean Mojito!  If you go to this place and  you don't order this drink you are missing out on the Soi 4 experience!  Eat up!
