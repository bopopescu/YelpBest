                best deep dish i ever had for a very long time; best in the area for sure. will go again.  We ordered the Med chicken and thought it was deep dish but came as thin crust; there was some communication error and the staff was great and offered us 50% even though we told them they didn't have to.  thin crust was great, lots of cheese and chicken!  the crust wasn't soggy...  went back second time and got the classic deep deep dish and we love it! so go get pizza,,,food is great and staff is awesome.
