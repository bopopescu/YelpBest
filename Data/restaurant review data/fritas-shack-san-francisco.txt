                Great new SoCal San Diego style mexican food for the Bay Area!  Love the fried food. Fresh ingrediants. Enjoyed the rolled-tacos and chile verde fries. They had a breakfast burrito option in the morning last Sunday at the Stonestown Farmer's Market that was very good because I was hungry at 9am and most vendors were still setting up.  Solid customer service and up-and-coming Bay Area vendor.
