                This place was pretty good. I like how it's casual and reasonably priced. There is a large variety of fish for you seafood lovers. I got the fish tacos, which were good, but not great. My wife got a salmon plate which again was pretty good, but not great. I will definitely come back to try fish and chips, though.
