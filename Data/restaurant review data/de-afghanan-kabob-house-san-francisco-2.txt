                Came here while on a short trip to San Fran and was in the mood for something spicy, this place did not disappoint  My date ordered Chicken Qorma and I got a Chicken Kabob, great combo for sharing. We both liked each other's dish so much we basically ended up switching plates. Chicken Qorma is a red sauce with chicken and chickpeas, great for dipping the Afghan bread, the seasoning on the chicken had a real nice kick to it. The chicken Kabob was also great, high quality and well seasoned.  Hope we can find food like this when we head back home.  

                Love this place! I highly recommended trying it out if you're looking to get your healthy veggies and protein fix. Everything was really delicious. I love the casual, easy vibe of the small restaurant. Service was speedy, simple, and sweet.   You really cannot go wrong with the Triple kabob platter. It came with chicken, tekka beef, and chapli, veggie salad, and two kinds of basmati rice. The chicken kabobs were my favorite -- so juicy, tender, and flavorful. Mantoo dumplings were soft, flavorful, and yummy.   Everything tasted so clean and fresh. I love my middle eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. I really appreciate their use of whole ingredients for flavors like cilantro, mint, and lime. Clean and healthy eating for the WIN baby!  

                I wonder how they make meats so tender. .... must be using a lot of fat / oil in the marinade.   Overall great food that's inexpensive too.  

                No change from my previous visit. This is still a good afghan restaurant. The customer service is good. I finally tried the Mantoo. It was also very good. The meat was fresh. The dumpling was soft and flavorful. It was a cross between Italian ravioli and a Chinese dumpling.  

                Ok, so the first time I dined here, I was all about it. Small, family-owned joint, on Geary and Van Ness.  My taste buds broke.  The borani badenjan was epic. I could've eaten eggplant for weeks. The yogurt sauce was perfect, the tomato sauce thick and flavorful. The bolani was the perfect combination of flaky and toasted on the outside, and filled with steaming and perfectly seasoned potatoes on the inside. The bolani and I were all up in that yogurt sauce. For dayz.  Only thing I didn't like was that the prices aren't on the menu. I like to know these things.  We ordered takeout tonight.  Disappointing:/  The sabzi and badenjan were just ok:/  Damn, maybe it was just the chef tonight? Gotta knock it down to 3 stars:/  

                Came here and both times are awesome. The place is quite small so it might be tricky for big groups.  This is my first time having Afghanistan food and it was amazing. First time I got the combo plate which contains 2 types of rice, beef patty, chicken kebab, some beef cubes. The beef patty was so well marinated and seasoned with a slight spicy kick. Chicken kebab was insanely tender and juicy, which totally blowed my mind.  The second time I just got the beef patty by itself with rice. We also got the lamb with raisin rice dish. Being a sucker for anything that contains raisin, it was good. The lamb is not terribly lambs which suits my taste. However the portion of the lamb was not big at all despite it was flavorful and tender.  I will definitely come back as much as I can.  

                We phone ordered take away on Super Bowl Sunday.   The order was ready right as promised. $32 for a bolani appetizer (way too much for 2 people) and a triple meat combo (lamb, chicken and a meat patty - served with breads, 2 kinds of rice an 2 salads.)  All in all too much food for 2 people, The meats were tasty - the chicken was super tender and the meat pat tie was well-seasoned.  It was all probably a bit too spicy for my tastes, but that is on me. Good luck to this little business.  

                I had the Bolani, the triple kabob platter, and the ice cream while I was here. The waiter was friendly. The food was fresh, hot, and delicious (be forewarned though a lot of it is spicy, so if that's not your thing then be careful about what you order). I went during lunch and we had the benefit of being the only customers there. No, it's not a large place nor is it overly fancy or pretentious. It is a simple place with a small and edited menu. Overall the food was great and I will definitely be back.   **great option for anyone looking for a neat restaurant near AMC 1000.  

                Tasty and original, this place has a flavor all it's own.   My gf and I were the only non-Afghans in the restaurant, so perhaps this is authentic Afghani cuisine.  In any case, it is delicious and worth a try.  I look forward to venturing here again when I'm in the neighborhood.  The creamed veggie appetizers were very good.  The ice cream with Rose flavor is worth a taste...and you won't stop at just one taste!  Yum!  

                I've ordered take out here twice. Both times the food is absolutely amazing. The Kababs are out of this world. The Bolani is incredible and the Mantus is the best I've ever had. If you enjoy Afghani food this place is by far the best in San Francisco. If you haven't tried Afghani food then start here. It's a hidden gem right on Geary Street and Van Ness. It has a nice Family feel to it and I'm looking forward to eating there sometime soon.  

                I'd say my party of 5 was very lucky to snag the only open table one hour before they closed.  After we sat, the waiter had to turn away other late comers since the restaurant wouldn't be able to accommodate them.  Anyways, we had a few beers and appetizers elsewhere so we only ordered communal dishes for everyone to share.  For starters, we ordered the bolani.  Bolani reminds me of naan but with potato filling accompanied by white yogurt sauce.  It's a great appetizer dish but for our case, it went rather well with the alcohol in our stomachs.  For mains, we shared the lamb kebob and the chicken, beef, and chaplee combo.  Let me start by saying how great the rice are.  There's two different types: white and brown.  While I cannot tell the difference, I can say that the rice were not oily like other restaurants.  The chicken was semi-moist but the beef and lamb were just right.  Overall, a great solid place to fulfill your Mediterranean cravings.  

                If there was a way to give 6 stars, I would award it without reservation to this amazing Afghan restaurant.  They recently opened their location in San Francisco at the expense of shutting down the one in Berkeley and I am sure those East Bay denizens are now in extended mourning.  It's a no frills place with amazing food and great service.  We had pretty much everything on the menu: the bolani, the spinach, the eggplant, and the triple kebab.  Everything was just flat out spectacular, seasoned perfectly and bursting with flavor in each bite.  Nothing was greasy or salty, the flavor was from fresh ingredients and expert cooking.  We had leftovers and were walking down Van Ness and a homeless person asked me for the leftovers.  Normally I would have said yes but I had to say no because I wanted the food for myself! I did give them some money to get their own food so don't hate me too much.   Check this place out before it gets too popular which, by how brisk business was tonight, means that won't be too long.  

                Great food and wonderful, warm service!  I remember when this place used to be a Mexican food place and was excited to see some new cuisine take over.   We had the Bolani, dumplings, and triple kebab plate (chicken, beef, beef patty). I'm generally not a fan of ground beef but the patty was delicious and well-seasoned/spicy. We had both the potato and pumpkin Bolani and both were really good.   All in all a really positive experience with great food. I will be back!  

                Tucked between two buildings larger than this one and you might walk right by it if you aren't paying attention, good thing we were. We came here to grab a quick lunch before an appointment. The place is small but that's good because you can smell all the wonderful food coming from the kitchen. The decor was plain and simple but stayed true to the cuisine of the restaurant. We got the bolani which is like potato bread of some sort that you pair with a yogurt sauce which is on the tart side. I usually like it and I did here. Very savory dish and a great way to start the meal. Be careful not to eat too much or else you'll get full and wont' want to eat anything else. We then got borani which I think is what it was which is like a ravioli. It was okay but it was the same yogurt sauce and the meat had a little too much spice which was overpowering. We then got a mixed kebab plate and sometimes when you order chicken kabob it is dry, but not here. That's how you can usually gauge how well the other kabobs were cooked. If you can do chicken right, chances are you can get the other meats right too. They did and I was so happy. Moist, tender cuts of meat over rice with salad, I was scarfing everything. No leftovers for us. It's a nice little addition to the neighborhood. Check it out.  

                Food: 4 Decor: 3 Service: 3  Been here twice with groups of 4.  1. Bolani Leek & potato-filled pastries baked on a flat pan served with yogurt and cilantro chutney half order Bolani ~Pretty good. Yogurt had a nice kick to it.  2. Kado Borani Roasted squash topped with garlic yogurt, dry mint and served with Afghan bread ~Pretty good.  3. Triple Chicken, Beef & Chapli kebab ~Pretty good. Proteins all cooked quite well, and I liked the rice and salad. Didn't care for the green onions on top though.  Service was mediocre. Seemed understaffed, and we had to flag a server several times.  

                Good Lord. This place is good. Small space, great for convos bc you can hear your friends/date speak without straining your ears. Low lighting so your friends/dates will look better, too. (jk)  I went on a Tuesday at 8:30 and every table (all eight of them lol) were full.   Now for the good part...I ordered a vegetarian dish ~ Bodinjon Borani (roasted eggplant w/ garlic yogurt & dry mint) and it was incredibly fresh and delicious. Not to mention it was prepared within minutes, probably because it was a vegetarian dish.   I have plans for sushi with a friend this Saturday, but I will be taking him here instead.  

                The food is delicious We had: 1- chicken kabob- chicken was moist and delicious, we had a mixture of white and brown rice 2- lamb kabob- very very good 3- lamb shank - delicious 4- Bolina- was paratha like with potatoes and scallions, wish the filling was much more   Service- meh, we received one of our dishes 10 minutes after everyone else received their food, which sucks because we were done and my husband just started his food, had to take it to go he didn't want to be the only one eating.   Had to flag our waitress down to get the bill, oh and there was only one other party in the restaurant besides us. Shame.  Service leaves lots to be desired.  

                Yes! The chicken Kabob is probably as good as it gets and is definitely deserving of a "WooHoo!".  Before I digress, I just want to say that it was one of the best chicken kabobs I've had ever had (bar none); soft and succulent, it was simply bursting with flavors! The seasoning was just right and you can tell that it was marinated for quite a while, and cooked quickly on high heat (for it to be so juicy). The green cilantro/pepper based sauce/chutney compimented the kabobs perfectly. The sides included aromatic long-grained rice, seasoned and cooked perfectly, in two different styles (or maybe one was brown rice, and the other white; I couldn't tell). The shirazi, or the eastern version of a pico-de-gallo made a perfect match for the rice and the juicy hunks of chicken.  We did, however, start with the Bolani. A flat bread that was stuffed with, in our case, potatoes and leek, served with a yogurt dip. I loved it! It was similar to an Indian "Alu Paratha" and I happen to love the alu paratha. As you could tell, that dish was a carb-country-fare on a plate. The bread was a little crunchy and a little flaky without being as leavened as a puff pastry (but tending towards that very slightly), with the soft steaming moist stuffing; dunking it in the seasoned yogurt, it was magic in my mouth!  I also tried a bite of the dumplings and they were *really* very delicious too. But having tasted the kabobs, I'd be hard pressed to order dumplings instead; but I'd be willing to, nay, love to, split a plate of kabob and a plate of dumplings with a dining companion --- if only I can fool them into not diving headlong for the kabobs.  I had a glass of the "Dogh", a savoury yogurt drink that was seasoned. It is akin to an Indian "salt" lassi; but I'd venture so far as to say that it is very close to a "Butter Milk". I love butter milk. But it may not be for everyone.  Next time, I wanna try the "sheer yakh" ice-cream.   At $61 for the Bolani appetizer, three entrees, and two drinks, the check for $61 (+ tips) was pretty reasonable.  I will be back.  

                I can't wait to go back and try all the other menu items. Today was my first visit and I had the tri-tip kabobs which were hot and juicy and succulent! Melt in your mouth! Service was quick and friendly which is just what you need on your lunch hour. I really hope this little neighborhood gem succeeds!  

                I love this gem.  BYOB. Get the chicken kabob and the lamb. Eggplant app is also good.   The green spicy sauce is so delicious. Put it on everything!  

                I came here last week with my family for my sister's birthday. I thought it was nice, cozy restaurant and everyone left satisfied. This restaurant only has 12 tables or so and doesn't take reservations, but we were lucky enough to get a table for 5 on a Friday evening with no wait.  We started with the pumpkin bolani - flaky pancake with pumpkin stuffing and yogurt topping. It was okay. Definitely spicier than we expected!  Next, we tried the bread with spinach. Reminded me of naan and spinach curry.  I ordered the Qabili Pallow, which is a rice dish with a lamb shank, topped with carrots and raisins. It was flavorful and sweet!  But the real winner was the LAMB KABOB. So tender and juicy, and oh so good!  

                Simply outstanding. Truly home cooked style Afghan food. The chaplee kabob is the best. Delicious, savoury and hearty.  Cozy little restaurant, friendly service. Great experience.   Highly recommend.  

                Self service.  Namesake is four or five stars. The chunks of marinated chicken breast were deliciously excellent. Includes rice and Afghani bread. Super reasonable $12 price.  If only the service was as good. Our waters were not filled, dessert was not offered and there was significant lag between menus/ordering and finished/check.  Small space didn't prevent with good conversation. But just know you might end up being mentioned in Leah Garchik's eavesdropping: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sfgate.com%2Fcolumnists%2Fgarchik%2F&s=3cf5ab3c4d7a64c40d33399de4b34d0daa00f1f351c020f335509c60e5aaf715" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sfgate.com/columnists/ga…</a>  Lots of potential. Lots of service misfires.  

                Manly man meals.   With the most restaurants per a capita in America, you would think that SF has a plethora of choices when it comes to restaurants that offer both quality AND quantity. Sure, there's Asian restaurants that give ginormous portions and charge as little as a happy ending in Thailand by a ladyboy (in USD) but the quality tends to be shit.   Enter De Afghanan Kabob House. Opening last Friday, they took over the old Cilantro and Best Burrito taqueria (down the block from Mel's Drive-In); making it their fourth location in the Bay Area (two in Fremont and one in Livermore).  What makes De Afghanan Kabob House a solid 5 star restaurant is they offer a delicious, stick to your ribs, manly meals with blue collar prices that doesn't compromise on quality. Hello halal meat! Thank you for making me feel better about inhaling a cow. *pats muffin top*  A great appetizer to share, the Bolani ($9.99) is a thin, crisp yet soft flatbread stuffed with potatoes and leeks. It was very satisfying especially with the tangy housemade yogurt sauce: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1kHgqJE&s=7237180e007ab023e3416de72d693bc27b0d34860764cec1e1232f7730246896" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1kHgqJE</a>.  A must order is their Triple Kabob Combo ($16.99) which was good for sharing unless you can eat for two: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1b2lll6&s=9c014d40f190ef63afe656cc9e712758da00f5d5224547b35cb25ea76275f2d1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1b2lll6</a>. Enough protein for days, all three chunks of chicken, three chunks of teka beef and two chaplee beef patties were very well marinated and cooked. The meat was incredibly tender and insanely flavorful with a nice herbaceousness. Even the chicken breast was as tender as perky boobies. The teka beef was my fav of the trio because the flavor was explosive and the meat melted in my mouth like a fine steak from a high-end steakhouse.   All platters are served with rice, salad, and warm Afghani bread. The combo platter, however, was served with both Challow and Pallow which were addictingly good. Challow is (white) rice with cumin seed and canola oil. Pallow is (brown) rice with cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, black pepper, cumin and canola oil. If you're going to indulge in carbs, this is the way to do it--with tasty, aromatic rice.   Don't be fooled by that mountain of orange rice in the Quabili Pallow ($13.99) because underneath all those carblicious carbs was an incredibly tender lamb shank: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1fmmb7W&s=fb56f1d95b88660c49988943741a081399c4bb666666c83d511b4049565dbf7b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1fmmb7W</a>. Loved the addition of raisins and carrots for a sweet crunch.  Even though we had enough leftovers for another couple, I had to try the Sheer Yakh: Afghan ice cream ($6): <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1fmmgbR&s=eb7725aeb52577e6efb7ac937caa3ee384d5a0d42e48fb188c8de2d303b47552" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1fmmgbR</a>. The vanilla ice cream with the rose water and cardamom was really refreshing and helped cool our palate from the complimentary Shornakhod: garbanzo beans and potatoes in tangy chutney sauce: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1ez285n&s=d156337815f5dd4c594928bd9edc398a9d4a904f4e72b1ddf96377234ca2723e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1ez285n</a>.  Service was pleasant and the food service was pretty prompt considering there were only two staff on the premises at the time.   There's only 6 four-tops and 1 two-top table so the restaurant is good for small parties only: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1gzALfR&s=878458aca5f6b8438066444066497dc105117463be0cffda2c9977e0ad1f19d0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1gzALfR</a>. Reservations are taken (I overheard another table having them).   Most of you know how damn picky I am and De Afghanan Kabob House definitely ranks as the BEST Middle Eastern restaurant in SF for me.   Please don't ever change, my fav manly man meal provider...  

                One of my favorite restaurants in town. Home/family like atmosphere and very flavorful food (which I can't say about too many places in town). If you want to surprise a friend or a date with a non-mainstream place that serves food that will blow their mind, this is the spot. It's a bit more pricey than your typical middle eastern cafe, but it's well worth it.  Sauteed pumpkin is a must dish .  

                Can't believe we found such a nice place offering fabulous food! Must back again!!!! The price is very reasonable!!!  

                DINNER REVIEW: Definite fan. Seen it from the 38 bus stop for a while and been wanting to try it.   FOOD:  Solid, laid back dishes with lots of sides and generous portions. I had the Tekka Kebab with a side of yogurt. She had the chicken kebab. The meat was amazingly juicy, how they got it that tender I may never know. Meat portions weren't huge, but there was plenty of other sides provided to mostly make up for it. Would suggest ordering a yogurt to eat with your meal.  ENVIRONMENT:  Clean, neat, and wonderful smelling inside. Nothing fancy, but real cozy feeling.   SERVICE:  Professional and fast. Everyone who worked there seemed to know their job and focus on it well. Waitress was friendly, quick and courteous.   SUMMARY:  Only missing that star because it lacked that "drunk from eating" feeling you get from a 5 star restaurant. Thanks Miles for pointing out my need for clarification.  

                Love this place, I've been here 2 times and the most recent one was on the first day of Ramadan. I came too early before iftar and she was cool with me sitting there and not ordering for another 30-40 minutes since at the time no one was inside.   20 minutes before iftar and the place is packed and my friend and I ordered our kabab dishes which took exactly 15 minutes to make. She gave me dates to break fast with and the food was out right on the dot. I got the combo with chicken, beef, and chapli all very good and only for $16. With each entree dish they also give a small bowl of chutney, beans, and potatoes which is really good. You definitely get your money's worth here. This place is a block away from Van Ness so its not in the heart of Tenderloin.  

                Food is alright if you ever get it S and I went for dinner, the place is very small, about 8 tables, and two waiters. We ordered two veggie dishes to share, rice and bread. One dish came out readonably quickly but really needed to be eaten with bread or rice. No bread, no rice. 15 mins elapse. Waiter swings by and leaves empty drink glasses on the table, not asking if we'd like water but inquiring to us if the rest of our food had come out. It had not. Another 10-15 mins elapse, the waiter came by, left to the empties again, and once again asked us if the rest of our food has come out. The rest of the food comes out about 5 minutes later, we finished the first fish without bread and rice since it's basically gotten cold by now. The waiter still hasn't cleared our empties, and our tiny table is getting cramped.   Food was good, service is awful. Skip this location which lacks all atmosphere and go to the Fremont location instead for a much better experience.  

                Very refreshing. Great Yelp recommendation.  Nice menu with not too many choices which means to me they focus on items.  Was delicious.  Cream spinach, chicken kabob and a cucumber drink, very tasty.  Very moderate prices and good service. Only 9 tables.  I give this place a deserved 5 stars.  

                This location is not as good as De Afghanan in Fremont. A very small restaurant with a limited menu.   I ordered the roasted squash (kado borani) but they said they ran out (on a Sat night at 7 pm). I really enjoyed the mushroom/spinach (sabzi challow) dish, it was light and had a lot of flavor, many herbs used. The eggplant and tomato dish (bodinjon borani) was not to my liking because it had too oily, had too much acid from the tomatoes and heat from the chiles.   We ordered food for two and only one meal was brought out but without any bread or rice. It took another 20 minutes to get the bread/rice and the food was cold by then. No water was given or offered.   The vegetarian food comes in very small portions, and in general they are lacking vegetarian options. When I am in SF and want Afghani food, I will stick with eating at Helmand Palace.  Gluten notes: Most Afghani food is gluten free - just don't eat the bolani (bread) and order a side of rice.  

                Best Afhan food I've had in a long time. Succulent chicken qorma, tender kabobs, great sauces. A shocking delight w/great service. Place is packed on Sat. nite. Come early.  

                This place is awesome. I got several things on the menu--the kebabs were tender and flavorful and the bolani was delicious. Bolani kind of reminds me of an Indian parantha--it's a thin, layered flatbread stuffed with a salty potato or spinach filling.  The service was relatively fast and the actual restaurant is small but homely. It could be a cute place for a date if you aren't looking for the quintessential Italian joint.   Plus points for the amazing bronze 3-D wall hanging of the famous Afghan girl's portrait from Nat Geo!  

                This is a truly special place.  Wonderful food and even more wonderful hosts. The  I have some limiting diet restrictions that for some reason are difficult for Sf people to get right. I don't eat grain or raw chicken.   Well it was no problem at this place. The server was warm an completely accommodating. She even offered to bring out extra salad.  And the food was so good.   My BF and I shared the sabzi, bodinjon borani, and the Chicken, Beef & Chapli combo.  Sabzi looks Indian saag but tastes  even better. Ridiculously good.  The meat is why we came and were not disappointed. Tender, perfectly cooked and delicious seasonings  Finally a place in SF that gets everything right.  

                Friendly staff, quiet and relaxing for a Friday night. Big portions: 3 of us shared a bolani, beef dumplings (my favorite - so divine and savory) and a kebab plate, which came with rice AND bread. We had to take 1/2 the bolani home and could barely finished the rest.  

                This place is fantastic. My goal with any Afghan place is to compare the Kabuli Palaw to others I have had. This place is awesome in that the dish is served with the lamb shank laying across the top. Most others I have had simple have chunks of lamb in the dish. The meat off-the-bone is so tender and juicy, whereas the chunks seem to dry out.  It is BYO, which is nice, and service is great. The prices are very reasonable. Definitely worth a visit if you're after very flavorful food...  

                Yummy food. Service was fast and friendly. Our family of four shared the eggplant, the pumpkin, the lamb shank, and the Manitoo. We arrived at 5:30pm and the restaurant was empty. When we left 45 minutes later nearly every table was taken. I recommend the restaurant. Only hesitation was the food was a tad pricey for vegetarian fare.  

                Was super excited when this place opened up.  Heard great things about the food, though when I got take out and had a view of the kitchen, I was not super impressed.  Th amount of things that were literally thrown into the microwave, made me question both the prices and the food handling.  Take out was super slow, even though everything I ordered was tossed into the microwave, and I called 10 minutes in advance.    The food was good, and I am trying to put my anti-microwaving feelings aside, since I think this is probably a common practice, that I just saw here in person due to the smallness of the space.  

                Is Afghan poised to be the breakout cuisine of 2014? I don't know what that means... and who talks like that anyway? All I know is that the few morsels I've had of it, I liked, whether it's Helmand Palace on Van Ness (review: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1nwaCkz&s=a0a8fc7c586fa880721bfc94c3cd7e16b8ddf2e604876181d4a8eb48dc04ae00" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1nwaCkz</a>), Kamdesh in Oakland (review: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1hWYRV7&s=25c5c6a693cc91a0d7bd33060d7baf80c125f1d309ecc9505bd28392af0a2db3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1hWYRV7</a>), or Ariana in New York (review: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FQmubkp&s=aad5de1a9ba451f220e968c05b4a92da0ad7eb4843c8498c8e608e05936e54b3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/Qmubkp</a>). This could be the best of the bunch, and ironically (food snob that I can be), it's part of a chain based in the Little Kabul section of Fremont. Ever read "The Kite Runner"? Yep, that neighborhood. I've never been to the one down there, but my guess is that this location does not offer as authentic a decor. No, the fairly spartan ambiance is in line with its Tenderloin location, including the door that couldn't remain shut after you close it. But the food pictured in the laminated menu looked appetizing and our inhibitions subsided.  We first received our bread basket of Bolani, a native flatbread freckled with sesame seeds (photo: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1hWWxgS&s=1aac0792f4c937341c872f681f61c184bbdb2384e15cfcd5598daec47a9a3611" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1hWWxgS</a>) along with a tasty dip that mixed chickpeas and diced cucumbers in a green sauce that I'm guessing was made from cilantro (photo: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1hW2REg&s=bc5c72f303425ed4aa3a71ce4a720d09673f0a60a59a2b7d1a148fdc300aaa97" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1hW2REg</a>). Already on the table were jars of spicy and mild sauces that we also applied to the bolani (photo: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1jT7Jth&s=d30f65a915273a16ed26423450130a9e8167c4053b31a7da1a6e0d3e60e6c663" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1jT7Jth</a>). I think the appetizer that came next was my favorite dish of the evening, the $6.99 Barani Kado, chunks of sautéed pumpkin seasoned in garlic and pepper with mint and a drizzle of homemade yogurt on the top (photo: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1gISAHf&s=0b982d133d2685f3bf94382fa38d260ae7ca093e6f27ebd3acc0a21013b0cf5d" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1gISAHf</a>). It was a nice combination of savory and sweet with the pumpkin providing just the right texture for a most enjoyable consumption. Jamie W. ordered the $16.99 Lamb Kabob, six big chunks perfectly tender from the grill accompanied by two different rices and a fresh side of chopped tomato, onion and cilantro (photo: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1ljroGx&s=823fc3c4e3bcb54ce1acc88ea80fdeb81878047e2ce389032a25369ab49d9358" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1ljroGx</a>).  That was quite satisfying, but I ordered their Triple Kabob for the same price. I got a combination of chicken, tekka beef and chaplee  This appeared to be the better deal for the insatiable appetite since I received three large chunks of the chicken, three of the beef, the same sides and a hefty ground sirloin patty mixed with scallions and crushed red pepper (photo: <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1jhKDJT&s=10d3245f58ad0674732f47e1b2922d3f959962a820e27ccd58f0a69e29ab5b73" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bit.ly/1jhKDJT</a>). The chicken was surprisingly moist and the beef was juicy, all of it quite tender and well marinated. But the standout was the chaplee because of the mix of seasonings mixed inside the meat. It was especially good with the table sauces. The server was quite cordial and informative about the dishes. She appeared to be the only one serving all the tables. It was really good eating, and I wouldn't hesitate to come back for more of that pumpkin. Maybe Afghan food is the breakout foodie fad, but what do I know?  FOOD - 4 stars...succulent kabobs, but it's the Barani Kado that stays in this glutton's memory AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...not much of it but it's clean SERVICE - 4 stars...terrific server really showed off the food with pride TOTAL - 4 stars...a strong four stars for this Afghan outpost of a popular South Bay chain  

                Came here for dinner last week with a group of friends. The inside was small but very clean and simple (in terms of decorations). My friend had commented he frequents their location in Fremont so he wanted to see how this new location stood the test.  We ordered the bolani to share and i ordered the lamb kebob plate. My friend was nice enough to share a chaplee pattie with me too. Basically we devoured everything bolani, meats, rice - everything including ALL THE SAUCES. The green and red sauce both delicious and meats were cooked perfectly and seasoned. Delicious. Delicious.  Never tried Afghan food - well me neither until this and I swear I had a food gasm here. Will be back! Update: my friend took her afghan coworker here and def legit!
