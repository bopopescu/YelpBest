                Came here for dinner last week with a group of friends. The inside was small but very clean and simple (in terms of decorations). My friend had commented he frequents their location in Fremont so he wanted to see how this new location stood the test.  We ordered the bolani to share and i ordered the lamb kebob plate. My friend was nice enough to share a chaplee pattie with me too. Basically we devoured everything bolani, meats, rice - everything including ALL THE SAUCES. The green and red sauce both delicious and meats were cooked perfectly and seasoned. Delicious. Delicious.  Never tried Afghan food - well me neither until this and I swear I had a food gasm here. Will be back! Update: my friend took her afghan coworker here and def legit!
