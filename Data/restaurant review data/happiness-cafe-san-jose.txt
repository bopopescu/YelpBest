                This family owned vegan establishment is a little piece of heaven for vegetarians and vegans. Everything offered here is plant based and adheres to the strict vegan code. No meat based products. So if you're a strict vegan, you're safe to dine, here no worries.  I've been here a few times and LOVE the mock pesto chicken on a baguette roll. Mmm flavorful. The baguette is fresh with crunch on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. Marinated mock chicken with a delightful pesto sauce. Tomato, lettuce, and vegan mayo. Can't tell you're not eating the real thing. Also tried the mock beef noodle soup and thought that was good but I'd rather opt for the pesto sandwich.  For dessert we had the waffles loaded with fruit and their vegan ice cream. Seriously good! I'm not sure what brand of vegan ice cream they serve but its as good if not better than regular ice cream.    My only gripe would be the prices. A bit on the higher side and the portions are somewhat small. The pesto sandwich is not that big for $8 and I can see people still being hungry if that is all that was ordered. Compared to places like Veggie Grill where you also get sides with your order. $8 only gets you the sandwich here. Not that great of a deal :(   Something for the owners to think of since french fries or a small mix salad wouldn't break the bank and make people a bit happier.   4 stars
