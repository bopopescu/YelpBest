                Yeah, this place is pretty darn good and gives Sol Food a run for their money. Had the veggie quesadilla and an awesome tapas dish of plaintains in a black bean sauce. Wasn't too busy on a Saturday night, which was cool as far as the fast service, but I hope they get busier because the place deserves a shot.
