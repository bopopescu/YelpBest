                Grazies' has gone through a few changes in the last 10 years. Presently it has the original owner running things. I went there on a Sunday and found it to be very busy. We ordered something not available at Brunch time, but they made an exception and served it anyway. This is what makes a restaurant, when you get what you came for. This is what we all remember, long after we leave. The burger was great, and my daughter cleaned her plate. Its hard to find good restaurants in Marin, so we appreciate their effort, and we'll be happy to return.
