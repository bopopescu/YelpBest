                Where to begin?! I never write reviews, but Napkins catering was so awesome that I had to l share the wealth! My husband and I used Napkins catering and event planning for our wedding last month. Simply put, everything was amazing.  We checked out a few different caterers for our wedding, but as soon as I met Skot and Jeff, the decision was clear. Not only was the food that they prepared for our tasting delicious, it was apparent that they understood what they were doing and how to do it well. It was important to me to not only have delicious food, but have a team that knew how to provide excellent service in a very tasteful and intimate setting. I'm typically a laid back person, but wedding planning is a lot of work and can be very stressful. Skot and Jeff were always there to address any questions or share ideas. I was overwhelmed with all the decisions that needed to be made for an event (colors, plates, silverware, napkins, etc. etc. etc.). However, Skot and Jeff to the rescue! They have exquisite taste and literally took charge for me. THANK YOU.  On the big day, everything came together so smoothly AND beautifully, it exceeded all of my expectations. We had roughly 80 guests and I can't tell you how many people approached us to tell us how wonderful the food was, the amazing service and overall what a fantastic wedding it was. I kept looking around me in awe at how gorgeous everything turned out. From managing all the larger logistics to adding small details....it just blew my mind. The food was presented so beautifully and it was delicious! Every member of their staff was exceptional as well. So professional, yet warm and friendly. Last but not least....their prices are very competitive. In fact, I can't imagine any of the other catering/event groups we met pulling off such an amazing event even if they charged twice as much! There's something to be said about having innate taste and caring about your work/art. Skot, Jeff and their team at Napkins catering are an amazing group of people and they do just that. Specifically to the bridge/groom looking for a catering/event company for your wedding- there are many vendors out there who will see your wedding strictly as a business opportunity and nothing else. Skot and Jeff made us feel cared for and I can't thank them enough for their pivotal role in our amazing day.
