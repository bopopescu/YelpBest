                My uncle and I wanted to have some Afghan kebab this evening so we decided to go to this new Afghan restaurant. We have been before to this place but it was under different name and management than. As soon as we entered the restaurant we felt the difference. They have beautifully decorated the place and we were welcomed by a smiling host. I ordered Afghan Kebab combination and my uncle ordered beef Kebab and we loved it. It was properly spiced and grilled or cooked. We also ordered Ferini and green tea at end and Ferini was great. The prices were reasonable as well. I will definitely come again to try the other dishes as well.
