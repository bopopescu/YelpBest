                Don't know why people here keep complaining about the wait.  If you want consistency and the best yakitori, you gonna have to wait.  Recommendation, come an hour early, put your name down, have some beers at Stein's.  They'll call you.  Whoever compares this place to Kitaro gots to get the F**K outta here.  Stick with your steak and potatoes and move to Boise, Idaho.  Or to the one that complains when the noise is too loud.  It's an IZAKAYA MUTHAF**KER! - Japanese drinking establishment, suppose to be LOUD!!!  Dipshits don't know what's up, better check yo self before you reck yo self, foo.  Eri chan and her fam do it right all the time.  Probably my favorite restaurant in SF.
