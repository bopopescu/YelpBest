                Simply amazing.  I wasn't super excited to go as I've to been to Ruth Chris so many times and although it's great sometimes enough is enough.  For the sake of change and a dear friend's birthday request we went to Flemings.  Great ambiance, service is unparalleled and the food was divine.  I was pleased to see some different choices from other steak houses.  The Flemings potatoes are off the hook and a compliment to any meal because they are just that good.  As I mentioned, it was my friends birthday and the staff brought her the most amazing dessert!  Truffles oh my!  Not your typical ice cream loaded with whipping cream and a candle buried within.    If you want a pleasurable dining experience and enjoy a good steak, go!
