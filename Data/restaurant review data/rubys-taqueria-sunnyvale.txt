                This was a wonderful place! I am hooked on the chili verde and can eat it plain right out of the pan. The meat was so tender you could cut it with a spoon or side of a fork. The portions were huge for me so I will have to skip dinner this evening but it was well worth it.   Fabulous tacos and a great deal $1.85 - they came with meat and guac on it - unheard of at most places. The meat was a bit on the greasy side carnitas and BBQed pork one of each was what I had. But it was not more greasy than any other Mexican restaurant that I have been to.   The location was off the beaten path but had plenty of parking and is in a residential area in Sunnyvale. Between Matilda and Fair Oaks off of 101. They have a great outside seating area that is protected against the wind and they don't allow smoking which is perfect for me.
