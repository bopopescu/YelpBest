                Amaaaaaazing! The best quality and priced brunch I've had yet in Sonoma County, and we've been living here almost two years! The crepes were amazing! I usually don't like much lemon flavoring, but it was perfect for this meal! It was about $9 and you didn't get that much food, so I also got two eggs scrambled on the side (the crepes are super worth their price). My husband got eggs Benedict and fell in love. You could see him entering a dream world on the first bite. He said these were the first real hash browns he'd felt he had since we moved here.   Love this has a real family feel and that the owner is busting her butt as much as everyone else. The staff was super friendly and cute girls. The one with the dyed burgundy/red hair was super cute, supporting and compliment in her work peers. A definite stop if you can!
