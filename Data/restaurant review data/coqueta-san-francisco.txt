                The city sounds. The romantic sights. A lighted bridge and beautiful nights. One lucky man. Â The lovely date. Coqueta charm illuminates. Sittin' on the dock of the bay... Otis surely came here to play. A perfect start... their gin and tonic. Floral, artful, flavors harmonic. A glass or two so warm so fuzzy. Her soft creamy skin flushed n rosy. Octo. Calamari. Top two musts. Razor clams retired... my secret lust. Love, life, laughter, we're medicated. Not authentic, Paella overrated. Ribeye med rare. Juicy perfection. Skewers so cute but skip the selection. Colorful sippins. Seductive nibbles. Cozy date night? An easy riddle... Deep into her eyes... she captivates. Intimate, lively... Coqueta awaits.
