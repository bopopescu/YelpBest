                They have chopan kabobs here which is lamb with the bone.  Most places have only the boneless lamb but that reduces a lot of the flavor.  I love lamb chops and they do it well here.    The restaurant has ample seating and is located in one of Dublin's many strip malls.  Service is underwhelming but the chopan kabob more than makes up for it..
