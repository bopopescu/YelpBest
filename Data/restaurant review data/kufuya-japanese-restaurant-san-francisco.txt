                Absolutely love this place! Very attentive and accommodating. You can't ever go wrong with $22 AYCE! Compare to Shabu House, Same sauce, Same thin slice of Kobe beef, their spicy miso broth is little different compare to Shabu House, not as spicy BUT you can always add more spicy to it. When ever you finish your plate of meat, they already have one ready for you, yup it's that goooood. I will definatly come back here again to feel my Shabu craving needs. Bye shabu house!! =P   Just a reminder, Tip and tax is already included, but still worth the $ saver and NO waiting. Love, Love, Love this place!
