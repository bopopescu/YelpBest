                We visited the Inn Kensington for brunch.  The small diner doesn't look like much when you first get there, but don't let that fool you!  The food is absolutely spectacular.  Everything they make contains quality ingredients and is cooked to perfection.  If you order a breakfast meal with a choice of bread, do yourself a favor and order the biscuits.  They are flaky and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Just do yourself a favor and come here. Right now. You won't be disappointed.  This level of awesome far surpasses most brunch restaurants in SF.
