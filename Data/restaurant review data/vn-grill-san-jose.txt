                I'm at the point now where VN Grill is what I eat for dinner 50% of the week..  what a sad life I live.. zzz.  It's just too close and convenient for me so I've been on a VN routine recently.  It's really close to Chipotle, Five Guys, and Pieology... I really like those places also.. but it's just way too unhealthy to eat so often.  That's where VN Grill comes in.  It's made of fresh ingredients and not oily/fatty and at the same time it's pretty tasty also!  I usually get the bowl w/ rice noodles, chicken, and everything (except Mint/Bean Sprouts/Basil) and it's great every time!  

                It's always nice to see restaurants breaking cultural barriers. It's a fun twist on the Vietnamese Classic vermicelli.  I had order the grilled pork and beef noodle bowl. My dish was surprisingly good and it didn't try to take away from the complicated Vietnamese taste palette to make it more suited to westerners. The meat was well season and tender a lot better then other Vietnamese spots on the east side. The different sauces and vinegars lets you play with your prefer taste. Their ngouc mam was good but I wish they had a spicy option other than adding it to the bowl itself.   Their lemonade-cucumber was really good and I highly recommend it.  

                Around 4:50, I was starving from being a couch potato and decide the time was now! Time to go get my munch on~   After consulting with Dr. Yelp, I found this place. My first impressions after I entered was like this place sorta feels like a Chiptole except red? A bit more hip too.  Anyways food wise, you just gotta pick whatcha want like at Chiptole. Choose either rice/noodle/salad then meat then veggies and finally sauce. So I ended up choosing rice noodles, vn pork, all veggies and then the sesame sauce plus a VN coffee.  Thoughts?  Vn rice noodle bowl 8/10  Solid taste, nice flavoring contrast between the sweet savory sauce with the veggie. You can really taste the mint leaves. Imma try the other sauces next time.  Vn coffee 7/10  This was a bit more bitter than my usual cup from like lees, but still good.   Worth revisit?  Yes  

                This has become one of my favorite lunch places during the week. I love asian food but I also love eating healthy, which is sometimes hard to come by. I've only ever gotten the rice bowls.   I'm a fan of the chicken, but not so much the beef. I felt the beef was way too tough and flavorless. Stick to chicken, or maybe the pork (haven't tried it yet). I love all the veggies you can put in it too. I always get the steamed veggies, which costs an extra $.95  They do charge for to-go orders (25 cents), which I find silly. They give you a large obnoxious bag to put your food in. Totally unnecesarry. They put stay-in orders in the same type of bowl, so sounds like there's a simple solution here that wouldn't require a $.25 charge. This is just a small pet peeve of mine though :)  

                I took a long walk from Bay 101 for dinner, and ended up at Vn Grill due to Yelp recommendations. The food was good but I wasn't blown away like some people. Then again, I have just been to Vietnam and know how awesome and cheap Vietnamese food can be there. Staff was very friendly here, though, so I'll round up to 4 stars. It was good, but I'm not running back to have it again.  

                The Vietnamese version of Chipotle!  If you've been to Chipotle, but are craving some Vietnamese food then you won't be a stranger to this place. You start by picking the base of your bowl (Rice noodles, white/brown rice, or salad. Then you pick the meat (pork, chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu). Now select your veggies ( I usually get them all!) Lastly, choose up to 2 sauces (fish sauce, lime soy vinaigrette, tamarind vinaigrette, or sesame dressing.  It's as simple as that! They put all of these ingredients of your choice in a bowl and have the sauce on the side so you can add as much flavor as you want. The galbi style beef was delicious and perfectly cooked! It costs a little bit more, but it's super worth it since they add so much!  The staff was very friendly and patient with me since I was a first timer. I am impressed by the food and the service and I will definitely be coming back for lunch. Keep it up!  

                A Vietnamese-styled Chipotle...next to an actual Chipotle!  If you have never been to a Chipotle, good for you. There's better Mexican styled food than that, but I digress... The way Chipotle works is that you choose a base, meat, veggies and then sauces. Vn Grill is no different.  Base - Vermicelli (Rice noodle), rice, brown rice or salad Meat - Beef, pork, chicken, tofu or shrimp Veggies - Lots of veggies!!! Wok tossed veggies at ~$1 extra. Sauces (pick up to 2) - Fish sauce, lime soy, tamarind or sesame ($0.50 extra)  As you can see, there are many, many combinations that you can make. I, however, am a simple person. On two different occasions, I got brown rice, all the veggies and lime soy dressing. The only thing I changed up was the meat. I tried both the beef and the chicken. I prefer the beef over the chicken because it's made kalbi (KBBQ) style!! It's perfectly marinated and they are generous with the portions as well. That's not to say, however, that the chicken was bad. The chicken was fresh and cooked perfectly.  The employees here are really nice. They called me by name after I ordered. The place is very well kept. They normally play sport games here, so I find myself watching the Warriors as I eat. Prices range from $6-9 depending on the meat  Overall, solid and healthy place to go eat! 4/5!  

                Came in and ordered food for my mom. It was my first time here so I was unsure on how to order but the menu seemed very simplistic so I wasn't too lost. Doui? Or deewee? I apologize if I butcher your name, was very kind in assisting me and helping me order.   The Vietnamese iced coffee sweetened with condense milk was strong and good!   The shrimp spring rolls tasted pre-made or frozen bc the rice paper was hard in areas, not something I would suggest ordering.   What I really enjoyed here were the bowls. The lime soy sauce was delicious. Ordered a bow with chicken and everything on it. I was tempted to add the wok veggies for about a dollar more but I didn't. Everything tastes fresh in the bowl which I liked. Definitely a place I would come back too and recommend to others.    Came in during lunch time and the place seemed very popular, can't wait to go back again!  

                I love this place. Fresh veggies and tasteful protein aka chicken. Everything here is pretty good and I love the customer service. Very nice staff and the place is well kept. An awesome tv is set up on the wall to keep up with sports. Want a good meal after the gym?! Come here!  

                Heard so much about this place, but they close on Sundays when I'm usually in the area. Finally got to go on a Friday evening, it's quaint and clean, and even have the communal tables like Chipotle.  Yes, it's a Vietnamese style of Chipotle. Pick your carbs (noodles, white or brown rice) your protein (I went with their pork), endless veggies (ranging from bean sprouts to basil) and then your sauce. Based on reviews, I went with the VN sauce (fish sauce) mixed with the lime soy vinegarette. The mini siracha bottles are to die for at the counter too!  Food came out quickly, and love how they put your sauce in a plastic bottle on the side. The noodles were a bit undercooked for my taste, but the meat was grilled perfectly. Lots of flavor. The jalapenos are hot! Had to take them all out! Their mini shrimp egg rolls are tasty as well!  For $8-$10 this place is tasty, cheap, and healthy!  

                Efficient, healthy, and tasty! What more could I ask for?  Janet O took me here and I started feeling a little hangry on our way over after sitting through The Hobbit. It's nestled in Brokaw Commons and we found parking easily. The setup reminds me of Asian Box.   I like how the cashier referred to me by name multiple times after I ordered. I chose white rice, Vn pork, Vn sauce and all the veggies excluding jalapeno, peanuts, and bean sprouts. Grabbed a seat at one of the communal tables and only took about 5 min to get my food. The tender, well-marinated pork really hit the spot and veggies added a nice variety of textures. Vn sauce (fish sauce) complements it well with its light umami flavor.  Janet told me that she gets hers without veggies so that they include more meat and after comparing her bowl to mine, I think I will do the same next time. I'm not a huge fan of raw veggies. Wok-tossed veggies are an extra 95 cents.  I'm glad we resisted the temptation to get popcorn at the movies and saved our stomachs for Vn! I'd love to try their grilled pork sliders and mini shrimp eggrolls in the future. Cám on, Janet! :)  

                Yesterday was my first time here at Vn Grill, came here with a co-worker after the lunch rush, if there was any (1pm).  I ordered the lemongrass chicken, brwn rice and load of vegetables. It was alright.  The place is modern, oddly modern though. The food... was okay. Being vietnamese, I have a very strong taste when it comes to vietnamese food.  I just don't get this place, flavorwise.   Probably, will never come back.  

                My friends and I were looking for a healthier dinner option and someone suggested Vn Grill. This place is fairly new and small. The ordering system is a bit like Chipotle or Pieology. You choose your choice of 'carbs', or you can pick salad. Then you pick a meat (tofu for vegetarians), toppings, and sauce(s).   I ordered the rice noodles with lemongrass chicken, all the toppings, and the VN sauce and tamarind sauce. I forget all the toppings they have, but they included things like: cucumbers, bean sprouts, lettuce, basil, cilantro, carrots, and peanuts. I was actually quite impressed and pleased with my order! Everything tasted really light and fresh. Definitely not a heavy meal at all, if that's what you're looking for. The sauces were really good. I ended up sampling all the sauces, but the VN and tamarind were definitely my favorite.   Overall, a good solid choice for when you want lighter, healthier fare.  

                INSIDE: clean, organized tables. Setup like a Chipotle or Pieology where you line up on the side you walk in against the wall, order in steps, then move to the side to wait for your food to be ready.   FOOD: straight forward options either noodles or rice, pick your meat, veggies, and sauces. Definitely a clean home cooked healthy taste to the food. I'm glad they have Thai iced tea because that's my favorite Asian drink. Pretty fast service too.   PRICES: seem reasonable to me and you can choose all the ingredients you want. Guy at the register has been the same the few times I've been here. Nice guy.  

                Food is great fast and tasty. Flavor is a lot like Asian Box in SF and Mountain View with fresh ingredient and style of Vietnamese food.  For fast fresh Asian food I think it's great.  4 stars only because the price is a bit too high compared to Chipotle across the way.  

                When I first walked in, I thought this place was quite similar to Asian Box in Mountain View. Pick a meat, pick a carb, pick your veggies, and pick your sauces. The difference is that this place gives it a Vietnamese spin to it.   I ordered a chicken rice bowl with a side of mini shrimp eggrolls, which were about the size of a pinky and really delicious. The chicken rice bowl came with a lots of chicken, and a decent amount of everything else. I liked that they leave all the sauces on the side and you can add as much or as little as you want.  I tried both the fish sauce and tamarind vinaigrette, and they mixed well together.  There were also several large TVs playing football, so this might be a great place to chill.  

                A very nice establishment by the owners of VN Grill. This might be one of my new favorite spots to eat at now!  Here is how it works:  1) Choose your carbs. (White/brown rice, rice noodles, or salad bowl) 2) Choose your protein. (VN pork, chicken, beef, shrimp, or to-fu-que) 3) Choose your veggie. 4) Pick your sauce. (VN sauce, lime soy vinaigrette, tamarind vinaigrette, or seasame dressing)  I tried the VN pork with rice noodles with all the veggies and for the sauce I choose the tamarind and vn sauce. I did not feel heavy at all after finishing a bowl of vermicelli. On top of that, the service was great also. I believe the guy who rang me up is the owner of VN Grill.  I will definitely be back!  

                This is my favorite place to go to eat! It's so good and healthy, which is a plus for me. The tall and skinny guy who I believe is the owner is so nice and friendly. Sorry I don't know his name.. They don't have name tags. But I always get good service when I come here. I love this place and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  

                VN Grill is located in the shopping plaza or should I say food plaza? haha...located near Chipotle, 5 guys, or Pieology. Friends took me here for lunch one day because they loved how fresh and organic it was. Yes, they had frequent it many times...what's the rave? Gosh, the menu is simple, but delicious! I had the rice noodles, beef, with lettuce, with their special sauce. Special sauce was recommended by my friends. Surprisingly, it was really fresh, light, and good! Vn Grill gives the sauce on the side, so you can put however much you want in your bowl. They do have vegetarian options. Instead of adding meat, they can add tofu instead. Instead of fish sauce, they have other sauces too. So, don't fret, vegetarians! I might take my parents here one day when they come and visit me again!  *** You can order online, pay online too! Pick it up for lunch. It does get crazy during lunch hours. ***  

                Really freaking good noodle bowl with beef that I had I would recommend this place to a friend for sure ! And they are organic and forward thinking very nice  

                Wow! I love their fast approach to feeding you! So simple and uncomplicated process.   Step 1 choose your starch. I chose brown rice. Step 2 choose your protein. I chose pork. Step 3 choose your veggies. I under ordered and chose only cilantro and basil. Next time I will add probably all? Step 4 sauce it up! I chose their fish sauce. Its not what you think. Its light and practically doesn't smell.   Warning. My steps might be out of order. But you get the idea.  I can only speak about my pork meat. But oh man! It rocked my taste buds. It catapulted me to be inspired to come back here again. Really! It's so damn tasty Im still thinking about it.   The portions are really excellent. Brown rice perfectly cooked. But all that and they're fast too? Wow! Did i say fast? Total lag time between ordering was a mere 5-10 minutes.  Great location. Clean. Knowledgeable and courteous staff. Cant wait to try the rest of their dishes. But I'm going to get re-acquainted with my pork dish again soon!  

                My love's dad actually told us about this place and I after working so diligently at the gym I decided to nosh out and thankfully found this thru yelp! So I ventured here and immediately this place reminds me of an Asian Chipotle- pretty cool.  My host I believe his name was Vien? He was chill, I told him this was my first time here and he helped me pick out the food bowls based on customer favorites.   I ordered the brown rice bowl with grilled pork and VN sauce and got my honey the beef with noodle and everything bowl. I also ordered a pork slider to go and went down the street for some ice tea.   I am so happy I went here on the rainy night because this is some serious health yet comfort food. The slider was on POINT and delicious and I was full so I ended up sharing my brown rice bowl with my mom who loved this and will most definitely want me to pick this up for her. Everything tasted fresh and is a pretty hefty size. My honey loved his bowl as well and appreciated that I went here because the food is legitimately  good and fresh!  I do regret going down that damn street and getting ice tea, I plan on returning soon for more sliders, a bowl and Thai ice tea and I want to try the cucumber lemonade oh and the spring rolls! ........this is why I lift people. So I can eat!  Overall will return, it's fresh food ranging from $9-15 per person which is really not bad considering it comes with a decent amount.  

                Like everyone else said, this is like a Vietnamese Chipotle for vermicelli bowls. You pick your base, your meat, your veggies, and your sauce. I think it would be cooler if they had everything out on display though, just for presentation points.  During lunch time, it gets pretty packed, but since service is fast and straightforward, we only had to wait a minute or so to snag a table to sit at.  I got the rice noodle, VN sauce (fish sauce), tamarind vinaigrette sauce (tangy sauce), pork, and all vegetables. The fish sauce is not as strong as the ones they use at typical pho restaurants, which might be healthier, haha. The pork meat was delicious! It was perfectly grilled, tender and not hard to chew.  Service was great. The guy who helped us was very warm, welcoming, and helpful.  Happy customer over here!  

                What a great concept, pick your starch, pick your meat, pick your veggies, pick your sauce, stuff your face! My good Yelp buddy Janet O took me here and I was happier than a pig in slop! I love Vietnamese food and this takes the guess work out of it for me, you just tell them what you want and they make your perfect meal every time.    I had the VN pork with noodles, most of the veggies, the grilled veggies (lightly grilled and still very crunchy cabbage, broccoli, and carrots, yum)(extra$) and both the VN fish sauce and sesame sauce. It was killer, I destroyed an entire bowl but didn't feel to guilty. The food is fresh, healthy, and just the right portion size.    I will definitely be back!  

                Like chipotle but Vietnamese style...  Got rice noodles, beef, everything except cilantro, vn sauce and tamarind sauce....delicious!  

                It took me awhile to give this place a try but I'm glad I did. My reluctance was that I thought I'd be disappointed by another Americanized Asian type of restaurant.  Their menu is a Chipotle style of orders. Pick what you want and they'll put it together. The only difference is that you don't get to see them make it in front of you.  I ordered the Noodles, Lemongrass chicken and all the veggies. When you pick the sauces they give you a bottle so you can add it yourself to the bowl. I choose the VN sauce (fish sauce) and the Tamarind Vinaigrette.  They also have bottles of Sriracha and Chili if you want to spice it up!  The ingredients were fresh, the chicken was very flavorful and didn't have the overpowering taste of lemongrass. I felt like they gave me a good ratio of noodles to chicken to veggies. I left feeling very satisfied and yet not heavy.   I look forward to trying what else they have to offer. I won't be too be quick to judge before I eat it!  

                Similar to the Bay Area chain, Asian Box, but more feels more solely influenced by Vietnamese food.  The food here is generally health conscious which is a good plus.  However, I would say that their sauces fall short, they're pretty watery and don't add much to the meal itself.  But the ingredients are always fresh with a variety of topping options.  I've only tried the beef here, but the quality is slightly under that of Asian Box, though still very good.  The toppings are also not bad here, though Asian Box does have them beat here as well unfortunately.  The lemonade here is nice with a variety of fruit flavors, they are a bit on the sweet side (I had to add water to mines).  Vn Grill is still a great place with healthy, quick meals and definitely worth checking out!  

                I heart this place! I could eat here every day! I like that it is street style food and the portions are big. Usually street style food has such small portions and is a little over priced, so I was happy that VN grill offers more!   I got 2 bowls: Noodles plus chicken and the lime soy sauce and the other with beef and I forgot the other sauce.   Basically their meat is juicy, not oily and super fresh!   I don't feel bad eating out here after the gym.  

                I think I'm most fascinated by the concept of this restaurant. This is a modern play off of the traditional Vietnamese dishes, I would most closely describe it as a Vietnamese Chipotle.   You first choose a carb (white/brown rice, rice noodles, or salad), then a type of vietnamese grilled protein (chicken, pork, short ribs), veggies, then a sauce all in a bowl.   The prices are super fair too; around $6-9 for the main entrees, ~$4 for spring rolls, and ~$2 for eggrolls - although not too comparable, this is cheaper than most traditional Vietnamese restaurants.   As a person who often prefers the taste of fresh and light flavors, this place is quite a solid fall back option for when I can't decide on something new to try.  

                EDIT as of 7/24/14: I just tried the pork slider for the first time and it is ahhhhhhhMAZING! The flavors are so good. Tastes like a pulled pork Vietnamese sandwich on a Hawaiian roll! All their produce is also sourced from the local farmers market (whenever possible and seasonally dictated). ++  **************************************************­************************************ I know my fellow Vietnamese people might not agree with my rating, but hear me out!  My first visit: "Meh, this does NOT taste authentic. What is all the hype about?"  Second visit: "Hmmm....interesting. Satisfying yet I don't feel heavy and weighed down like I usually do after a bowl of vermicelli."  Third visit: "My new guilt-free healthy(ish) Vietnamese food!"  Being Vietnamese, I was highly critical of this place during my first visit. To me, it didn't taste authentic (i.e. moist and oily). But after repeated visits (I'm not even kidding, they know me by name now because I come in multiple times a week :X) I have really started to appreciate VN Grill's vision.  - Flexible ordering (Chipotle style): Choose rice, noodles, or salad. Then choose protein, veggies, and desired sauce. Regardless of rice, noodles, or salad your price is determined based on which protein you choose. - Less carbs, more protein. They really pile on the meat here! I always find myself needing more vermicelli because I have so much leftover meat. - Extremely friendly owners  I usually like to get the beef or shrimp with rice noodles (vermicelli), a cucumber mint lemonade (so refreshing!), and if I'm feeling extra fatty that day I'll also get an order of spring rolls too (don't judge me).  Closed on Sundays. And parking sucks especially during lunch time since there are so many businesses and it shares the same parking with City Sports, so come early for lunch or swing by for dinner instead. If only they had some kind of rewards systems or loyalty card, I'd probably have a couple free meals by now. X_x  

                VN Grill is another variation of the Vietnamese Chipotle, and potential competitor of Eat Viet in the Santa Clara/Milpitas area. Unlike Eat Viet, they didn't mess up on the amount of marinade/sauce on my order!   I ordered the To-fu-que with lime soy vinaigrette on brown rice and all veggies possible ($6.95). (The lime soy vinaigrette was recommended by the guy at the front, Dewey, and it was spot on!) While they do put the vinaigrette in the bowl already when they serve it to you, they also bring out a bottle of the sauce in case you want more, which I definitely liked. Overall, everything tasted really fresh, light, and for $6.95, I can't complain too much!   I also got a Vietnamese coffee for $2.95, and you can't really go wrong there either, especially if you are already used to the bitterness of it.   I will come again!  

                Decided to try this place out since I was craving Vietnamese. Most of the reviews were right, it's very light and refreshing. But then again, I can get it at any authentic Vietnamese restaurant and it would also light and refreshing.   Missing three stars are for the following reasons:  1. I ordered the beef noodles with all veggies. The beef had pieces that were not fully cooked, it was still pinkish red.   2. The sauces they had were lacking in flavor. The signature VN sauce was nothing like the traditional fish sauce mix you get. It tasted weird. The tamarind sauce didn't taste like tamarind... Both sauces were rather warm, should be cold.   3. I ordered one of their seasonal lemonade, passion fruit. For a person who likes sour things, it was a bit to sour for me. I didn't taste much passion fruit and the passion fruit seeds were really annoying. Most places would give us a heads up.  Don't think I would return. But wouldn't mind if no other place was open.  

                I don't know why people are calling places like Pieology a Pizza Chipotle or V'n Grill a Vietnamese Chipotle.  Y'all gotta understand that it's its own category of restaurant now!  DIY! (Do It Yourself).  Rant aside, I have Vietnamese food quite often.  I have pho and banh mi at least once a week, so you can imagine my surprise when I came here.  It was like having a Vietnamese sandwich without the banh mi... or pho without broth!  And how was it?  Great.  I decided I wanted to try this place out after a rather testing arms workout, and while I felt embarrassed because I almost dropped my tray, I couldn't get over how fresh every everything tasted.  I guess it gets its comparison to Chipotle because it's fresh ingredients in a bowl.  The difference here is instead of choices of salsa and cheese, it's just rice, veggies, and a meat.  They also give you this amazing house soy sauce, and according to the waiter, it's good for you.  You can drench as much of the soy sauce (and Sriracha) as you want in your bowl to give it more flavor.  If I were to compare the style to anything, it would probably be Korean bibimbap, without anything sizzling.  Just fresh food drenched in whatever sauce.  I'll definitely be back.  

                "V N Grill cuisine, you're unforgettable, Fine, fresh, fierce, you got it unlocked Local tasty food that got you comin' back Ohhhh ohhhh, ohhhh ohhhh." -- to the tune of Katy Perry's 'California Girls'  Fresh and delicious! Yes, it's not completely authentic Vietnamese food, but that's not the point. VN Grill uses fresh, local ingredients and it sure shows in the taste. The one and only #1 South Bay Slumdog invited me here for lunch, and I'm sure glad he did.  FOOD: -------- The **Grilled Pork Sliders** are the bomb diggity. They're loaded with tender meat that contain so much flavor. Those sweet buns make such a difference -- Hawaiian rolls are a great take on the slider. Definitely a must order! We had the *Shrimp Spring Rolls** which comes with 4 pieces and is perfect for 2 people to share. These came with tasty peanut sauce and were very fresh.  Since I grew up eating **Vermicelli Noodles with BBQ Pork** I had to give them a try. This is a more modern type of cuisine so I was not expecting the traditional dish, but it was still very similar -- meaning it was delicious!  SERVICE/AMBIANCE: -------------------------- Service is very friendly and helpful when explaining the menu. You can build your own dish, which can be overwhelming to the first-timer since there are so many options, but the staff can assist you. The place is basic, clean, and bright. Lunch hour on weekdays can be super crowded, so if you want to avoid the rush you should come after 1 pm.  TIP: You can order online from their website (<a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvngrill.com&s=372550531a37222277000c7b00a34c6482cd6aeae56773cd0d1dc1d1c1c17487" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">vngrill.com</a>) or use the mobile app so you can take your food to go!  

                I thought Vn Grill was going to be like a Mongolian BBQ, but it was just like a Vietnamese Chipotle! except without the bar, so you order at the counter and they're pretty fast. The options are actually pretty simple, even though it looks like there's a decent amount on the menu.  The lemon grass chicken and fish sauce were delicious! I just wish I had ordered more toppings. I only got the wok-cooked veggies, which were just broccoli and cabbage. The meal could've been much more flavorful if I had ordered more! I guess that's my fault. I'm not a huge sauce person, but I love my Asian sauces. And thank goodness, because it's honestly pretty plain without the sauce. I love that they give you a whole bottle of the sauce for you to squeeze at your pleasure.  I went Friday for lunch, and there seemed to be just enough seating for everyone. I didn't really notice the atmosphere, and the cashiers were nice and patient for us first-timers. I didn't realize they call your name since they never asked--they just pluck it off your credit card!  

                VN Grill is the new hot spot in San Jose if you're into fresh, healthy, and modern VN food!  I love the setup up from the TVs on the wall, to the crafty 4 step menu, and a rustic urban decor/seating.  Definitely a place where all the cool kids want to go to get their grub a dub dub on....so I decided to invite that cool SB Yelper Denise L. to peep this place out with me!  ~~~What's good~~~ Grilled Pork Sliders - these were yum yum in the tum tum, on that Sweet Hawaiian roll, fresh cucumbers, and the pork was o so juicy...Must Have Item...MUUUUUUSSSSST!!!  Vermicelli noodles with BBQ pork - pretty good and on point if you are looking for your Vermicelli fix!  Shrimp Spring Rolls - Got an order of 4 and we downed those like there was no tomorrow, don't forget to dip it in the peanut sauce yo!?!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I am definitely going to be back here to try other items on the menu.  Next on my hit list Tofu Spring Rolls and Chicken Rice Noodle Bowl.  ~~~Quick Notes~~~ *It gets pretty crowded from 11:30am-1pm weekdays and it might be hard to find a seat so plan your lunch break accordingly. *They are closed Sunday :( *Tables are small so for large parties you will have to connect the tables.  

                Came to the shopping center looking for some grub.   On our way to a different restaurant, we saw Vn Grill and decided to check it out instead.  I'm glad we did! This is an eco-conscious company and the food tasted very fresh.    Here's the way to order: you first pick your base (white/brown rice, rice noodles or salad),  then you pick your protein (pork, chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu).  All are cooked in a different marinade.  Next, you need some fiber.  Lots of veggie choices here.  Finally, you pick your sauce(s).    I chose white rice, chicken (lemongrass), lettuce, basil, peanuts with sesame dressing.  The food came out quickly but it needed a little mixing to get all the different ingredients in each bite.  After that, I thought my bowl was really nice. My Thai iced tea was on the milky side but it wasn't bad.  The cafeteria style is not my favorite.  I'm not a fan of communal seating and the benches and chairs are not comfortable.  Even so, I will definitely come back.  I just might get it to go next time.  

                Love this place! Simply put, it's the Vietnamese version of Chipotle!  Value for money, and I would come here more often for lunch if it were closer. This is definitely my new go-to place after getting gas at Costco up the block.  You only get to choose 2 sauces.  Tried the VN fish sauce and Lime Soy.  You can cheat and get the other one at the sauce return station...=P That's how I tried the Tamarind sauce and fell in love with it!  Will be back!  

                Traditionally modern . . . Great and accurate slogan!  My sister suggested we come here because she knows the owners. Nice place for lunch located in a new plaza.   I would describe this place exactly like what it says on the window. It is traditional Vietnamese food, yet they added a very modern twist to it by allowing the customer to pick out what they wanted on their meal (Chipotle style). Pick your meat, your carbs, your toppings, and your sauce. Easy as that. After you order, they bring your meal out to you.   You have a minimum of four choices per category so there are a great number of combinations. Love it that they have brown rice for the health conscious and that the sauces can be mixed together for a different taste!  The food tastes and looks authentic. I ordered the BBQ pork with rice noodles. The port was a little overcooked though, but no biggie. I was very surprised considering the concept, but I'm glad they were able to keep the integrity of the food and yet still be new and fresh.   My only suggestion for them is to possible change the sauces. The sauces are bland in my opinion. I had to add a lot of chili sauce to get it the way I like it.    Prices are good. About the same as what you would get at another Viet restaurant. Another plus is that they are very into protecting the environment so bowls and utensils are made out of recyclable or compostable materials.  

                This place is like the chipotle of Vietnamese food. Interesting how there is already a Chipotle at this plaza and Pieology (the Chipotle of pizza) too! Lots if options for folks here.  Ken L. and I were originally going to go to Pieology but opted to go here instead due to the long line. I'm glad we were able to try this place for the first time since we heard so much about it from friends.  Here's how you order: 1. Pick white rice, brown rice, rice noodles, or salad. 2. Choice of meat, shrimp, or tofu. 3. What type of fresh veggies (all or a select few) our the option to pay more for stir fried veggies. 4. Pick your sauce: VN sauce, lime soy vinaigrette, Tamarind vinaigrette, or sesame dressing for an added charge.  They also have spring rolls, pork belly buns, egg rolls, Vietnamese coffee, and fresh lemonade.  Ken L. had the VN Pork with brown rice, fresh veggies, and VN sauce while I had the rice noodles soy glazed tofu, and lime soy vinaigrette.   The food comes out quickly here and everything looked very fresh. The sauce seemed a little watered down so I ended up having to use more than I usually do for more taste. Other than that, I enjoyed the flavor of the tofu and the amount of fresh veggies given. You are given a bottle of the sauce so you can add as much as you want and share with others at your table.  Over all, the food and portion size was decent, service was great, and they use environmentally comparable foodware. This is another great option to eat when you're in this area.
