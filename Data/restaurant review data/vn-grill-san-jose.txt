                This place is like the chipotle of Vietnamese food. Interesting how there is already a Chipotle at this plaza and Pieology (the Chipotle of pizza) too! Lots if options for folks here.  Ken L. and I were originally going to go to Pieology but opted to go here instead due to the long line. I'm glad we were able to try this place for the first time since we heard so much about it from friends.  Here's how you order: 1. Pick white rice, brown rice, rice noodles, or salad. 2. Choice of meat, shrimp, or tofu. 3. What type of fresh veggies (all or a select few) our the option to pay more for stir fried veggies. 4. Pick your sauce: VN sauce, lime soy vinaigrette, Tamarind vinaigrette, or sesame dressing for an added charge.  They also have spring rolls, pork belly buns, egg rolls, Vietnamese coffee, and fresh lemonade.  Ken L. had the VN Pork with brown rice, fresh veggies, and VN sauce while I had the rice noodles soy glazed tofu, and lime soy vinaigrette.   The food comes out quickly here and everything looked very fresh. The sauce seemed a little watered down so I ended up having to use more than I usually do for more taste. Other than that, I enjoyed the flavor of the tofu and the amount of fresh veggies given. You are given a bottle of the sauce so you can add as much as you want and share with others at your table.  Over all, the food and portion size was decent, service was great, and they use environmentally comparable foodware. This is another great option to eat when you're in this area.
