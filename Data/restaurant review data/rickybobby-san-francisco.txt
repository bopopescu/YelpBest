                They changed their menu!  A lot of the pictures I was looking at from only a month ago are mostly gone.  I think their menu wasn't as good as it was before.  Service was decent.  We were able to order drinks during our 45 min wait.  I decided on their house red wine which was a sweet cab with a very heavy pour.  The tables are communal which gives the place a very casual ambiance.  The server that took our order was very personable; he sat down at our table while he took our orders.  Seems like the workers were having a bit of fun in the back and enjoyed working there.  Garlic Fries: We ordered it for the table.  There were five of us and we didn't even eat half of it.  Plenty of fries!  The orange mayo sauce was really good. The Green Goddess:  Basically a cobb salad but the ratio of lettuce to the other stuff in the salad made it different.  Way more shaved cucumber, radish, and carrot than lettuce which was a nice surprise. Bacon Hamburger: I'm not a burger person but this burger was really quite tasty.  Delicious actually!
