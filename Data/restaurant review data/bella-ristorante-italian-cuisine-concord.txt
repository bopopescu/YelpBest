                Haven't been here in a while, and stopped in with the family. Â The food was a bit delayed, but the owner graciously apologized and offered free glasses of wine. Then for the food. We had the porcini mushroom with truffle ravioli and were in HEAVEN! Better than many of the Italian restaurants in Italy! The frutti di Mari was fresh and delicious and the kids devoured the pumpkin ravioli. Highly recommend this friendly restaurant!
