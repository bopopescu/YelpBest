                I was very pleased with the catering they did for my mom's birthday party!  They were extremely helpful with the planning side of it and on the day of the party the food was delivered promptly.  The delivery guy was very friendly and although he had to make two trips (apparently he had forgotten the receipt), the second time he made sure to bring some extra sauce with him for the appetizers we had ordered.  We received a lot of positive feedback from the guests so I would highly recommend them!
