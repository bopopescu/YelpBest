                #7 grilled pork sandwich was very tastey. Nice warm bread, sweet and sour pickled turnip/carrot slaw, cilantro, and jalapeño pepper slices with mayo. Bread was not too crumbly like other Vietnamese sandwich shops I've tried and grilled pork is flavorful. Nice combination and for $2.99 before taxes, I'm hooked.  I also tried #1 ham, pate, headcheese without the ham and have to say, I was not a huge fan of headcheese.......first time trying it and had a hard time getting past the gelatinous texture with crunchy bits which wasn't too appetizing for my palate.  However, for those headcheese fans, don't take my word for it. The pate on it tasted similar to a thin layer of liverwurst. I probably would have been ok with just pate and the trimmings.  Overall, #7 will be my pick every time I crave a Banh mi :)
