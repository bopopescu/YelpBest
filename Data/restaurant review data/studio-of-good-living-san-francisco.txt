                We had a terrible experience with this business. Even though we have known the owner operator for many years, they provided a terrible service for us this holiday season. We had planned a holiday party at our House for about 45 people. Our FOOD budget was $1500 which we think should have been more than sufficient particularly since we provided all the alcohol and soft drinks ourselves. We were planning a pass around appetizer event and met with the caterer to plan it. She provided a menu which looked good on paper and also recommended having 3 people including herself. Two servers (one bartender and one food server) which we thought would be more than sufficient. Everything was OK until half way through our event, when they pretty much stopped passing around the food. There was a lot of food in the kitchen but very little was being passed around. We had to repeatedly ask them to pass more food around which they did not. Our guests had also brought desserts which we had told the caterer to be prepared to serve. She served a few pieces of dessert and then stopped. We had to cut up the desserts ourselves and force them to pass it around. The owner chef did not hesitate to help herself to desserts and had a couple of helping while our guests were going without! This was not the worst of it however, magically at the end of the night all the extra food disappeared. We did not notice this until the next day however as we were busy entertaining during the party. They claim that the food got thrown out, but we checked the trash and there was nothing in there. There was a lot of cheese and even caviar that disappeared and we do not believe they were thrown out. So all said this is not a catering company that we would ever work with nor would we ever recommend them to anyone. PLEASE AVOID!
