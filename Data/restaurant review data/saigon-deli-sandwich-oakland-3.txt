                Every time I need a taco or a burrito, the first thing came to mind is here! Every time I want to make my boyfriend happy, I always come here! Every time my friends want something different to eat, I make them come here!  Above all, I feel this is the best taco&burrito I  ever had in the bay. The customer serivice is friendly & one of the male cook is super awesome!  

                What can I said, the food is good specially the pork n chicken BBQ sandwich are the bomb n for $3 even better.  The only place you can eat a good lunch with out breaking ur piggy bank. Customer service is great plus u get a free taco even better.  The only bad thing is that they only take cash  

                My first thought of this place was like..who on earth would ever serve tacos with Viet food? But little did I know that the tacos here are BETTER than most taco trucks out there on international blvd.   For me, it was like the best of both worlds (just how I like my women; haha my gf is also viet and puerto rican ;) ) and it's SO unique to have these two types of food in a single shop.   The place is fairly small but you can always order to-go! The prices for each item are inexpensive and worth it for what they're giving you. Perfect ratio for meat and veggies in the banh mi. The salsa is FIYAAAAAA. Muy caliente but solid when you top of the tacos with it!  The owners here are so nice. I believe it's a couple that owns the place. The husband (from what I heard) would randomly offer free tacos sometime for the customer to try! Really friendly, approachable, and social too.  

                Service here is always great. The man Tony is very good at greeting his customers and he makes a good ass taco. Lololol. I like ordering the pork cake here. And my bf orders the cóm duc biet which is a rice combo. Big size pork egg and shrimps serve with rice. There is some parking since this place shares parking lot with other stores also.  

                When you combine two of my favorite foods, you're a winner in my book. Why aren't there more of these around in Oakland? Vietnamese and Mexican food under one roof and you can't go wrong ever!   The combinations are endless! Al pastor banh mi! Carnitas and and fried egg banh mi. Bbq pork torta?  Def a spot to check out if you're in the area. Oh and they give you a free taco while you wait and the owners are very nice.  

                Time: 2:37pm/60°F cloudy  Purpose: Got a call from a soon to be open business nearby. At intersection look over saw laundromat then a sign saying banh mi and tacos. Thinking to myself how can that be? Are the owners confused or there's a identity crisis? Light turns green, I made a left instead of going straight.   Ambiance: I put it at better than your average hole in wall places. What set this place aside is the owner part Mexican and Vietnamese, speaks both languages fluently. Amazingly that's a first for me. I'm sorry that I can't speak neither languages. Pretty lack luster inside but, manageable and functional for the sole purpose of sitting down for a quick bite. Beverage fridge, combine close tables sits six people, couple of tables sit two, counter, steam table (non functional), snack rack, register, menu boards. Most notable feature is their combine business licence located on table top, plaque displaying their share venture.  Staff: Guy with tatts on left forearm spoke perfect English. Greeted me as soon as I walk in. Mention to me that they are a mixed place serving Vietnamese and Mexican food. I said great, I happen to be adventurous eater. I scan the limited menu within a minute of entering, I knew what I wanted. No sale pushing here as you order what you want, not what they want you to get.   Cleanliness: Grade B-, I think this is fair enough as place was a lack luster to begin with. Needs fly zapper or sticky tape.  Eats/Drinks: Al pastor and lengua taco $1.50ea, and can of soy drink $1.50. Both tacos were delicious freshly made to order. Had generous amount of meat and certainly no skimping on even the fixing. Got a oil infused whole jalapeño w/stem attached, 2 slices of radishes, quarter slice of freshly cut lime. After putting it altogether you're on your way to grub the tacos. Pastor was real tender none of that dried up crap seating at the warmers. Lengua was well seasoned also tender and nothing dried up to the point that you can't see the buds. Definitely a winner for both IMHO.  Products/Services: Banh mi, shrimp rolls, fish cakes, pho, rice plates/over rice, catfish and pork clay pots, combos, tacos, burritos, quesadillas, pastor, pollor, asada, cabesa, lengua, chariso, buche, tripas, avacado shakes, boba tea, cold/beverages, chips, bagged onion rings, seaweed seasame crisp, young coconut juice.  Punch Lines: Multilingual, friendly, warm hospitality, inviting, lack luster deco, seating compacity 26, close-together tables, pleasing flavors, zippy service, free samples, owner comes and greets you, inexpensive, budget watchers, calm vibe, eat in/take out, real avacados use, cash only, street or private lot parking.   Tradeoffs: A real good concept for getting the best of both world in one place. International blvd is known for its multicultural background. When you come here you can perhaps get a burrito and banh mi in the same place without leaving the block. How convenient is that?   Final Thoughts: I never thought that I would see a place like this with owner of speaks both languages. Vietnamese and Mexican is not too common like Chinese/Vietnamese very interesting mix here. The food overlaps those of food trucks as a burrito here weights nearly 3lbs, its girth circumference fill to the max, saw a person receiving their order. Good place for quick light bites, as its well prepared quality ingredients without sacrificing taste or skimping on meat. I can see myself in here with $10 on hand for lunch and dinner when I'm broke, can't remember the last time I went broke though? Wish there was a place like this back in my open campus school days. Let's do 3.5 stars for this place!  

                All the hype about this place is true!   The idea itself is unique: Vietnamese and Mexican food under one roof. If you're like me, those are two of your favorite cuisines, and you just hit the culinary jackpot. There are several tables inside, but it's still fairly small, so I would opt to take my food togo. Don't be an uncultured dummy and come here expecting to get pho or soup, but do expect to get a solid banh mi. Do not be a noob and try to eat banh mi in your car on the way to wherever it is you're going, you will be covered in crumbs (a sign of a good banh mi!)  and everyone will laugh at you. I've tried the combo and the bbq pork, and while both were damn good, the latter was my favorite. The ratio of meat to veggies is perfect, and the bread is spot on--crunchy on the outside, and super soft on the inside. Both times I tried to save half of my sandwich for later, and both times I failed.   The place is run by a Vietnamese-Mexican couple, and Tony (the husband) is the absolute sweetest person on earth. His wife is a little more standoffish, but not rude or anything. Today he offered me a free taco alpastor while I waited for my sandwich... and good lawd. Some of the best alpastor I've had, and the salsa was on point too. It comes with some seriously good grilled jalapeños and onion. Tony chatted it up with me for a bit and asked me to bring my friends and family here, which I definitely will! If you're sleeping on this place you are seriously missing out.   Extra plus: super cheap and affordable.  

                The tacos are awesome here!!! I love that I don't have to say "no cheese/white sauce/sour cream" here, what I get is just an authentic Mexican taco. $1.25 per taco is a good deal for these parts as well. They are most well known for the al pastor tacos, but I've heard good things about the fish tacos as well. Will have to try that next time.  Along with 2 tacos (al pastor and chicken), I also got 2 banh mi (meatball and fried egg) and a tray of 3 Vietnamese spring rolls. Total was $12. My husband and I scarfed these down, and although we were full, we loved everything so much that he asked me to order more for dinner.   So we ordered another chicken burrito ($7). When I picked it up, it was HUGE!!! It was like, 50% larger than a stuffed-silly Chipotle burrito. Great value.  Tony, the owner, came out to greet the patrons who were sitting at tables inside the simple little shop. He was very jolly and friendly, and when he saw how much we were eating, he offered to give us "something very special." A few minutes later, he came out with 2 free al pastor tacos, raving about how good it was. He thought I had ordered steak tacos, but I didn't complain about getting more tacos. :D  My husband, ever the smart one, decided to eat the jalapeno on the plate before eating his free taco. Uh. BAD IDEA. His mouth was immediately on fire and a cup of water I got for him didn't quench it. So I ordered a Thai tea ($2.50 I think). Yup, we sure ordered a ton of stuff here...lol. The Thai tea instantly quenched the fire in his mouth and not only that, he said it's one of the strongest and most delicious Thai teas he's ever had.  The burrito was eaten for dinner the next two nights...it was so huge that even my husband, who is the type of person to order 5 entrees per meal on a cruise, made 2 meals out of it. He vouches that the burrito is just as amazing the second night as the first. :)  Score on all fronts! - Excellent tacos - Excellent banh mis - Excellent Vietnamese spring rolls - Excellent burritos (and HUGE) - Excellent Thai tea - Excellent customer service  Can I give 6 stars? :)  

                Love this place!!! Nice people! Good costumer service!!! I always order their sandwiches and always ask them to add extra vegetables and peppers! They hook it up! Their tacos mmmmm so so good!! This place is a friendly place to eat at! I got the pic of the sandwich with extra vegetable and peppers!  

                I love how unique the set up of this restaurant is. Not fusion, but distinctly Mexican and Vietnamese served at the same place.  Al Pastor tacos are the best! The tacos are legit Mexican street tacos- small, but flavorful and fresh. I'm not a fan of cooked fish, but my husband raves about the fish tacos as well. The carne asada, pollo, lengua are all solid, but Al Pastor still takes the cake.  The banh mi sandwiches are solid, but nothing out of the ordinary. The Shrimp diabla plate is big and is great to share between 2 people. Not really spicy, but tasty!  Tony has great customer service. When he isn't busy cooking, he comes out and greets all the customers and really makes everyone feel welcome. When they have fruit, he usually brings some to each table.   If it's your first visit to Saigon Deli Sandwich, let them know and they usually offer some sample tacos for you to try.   The tacos and Tony will always keep me coming back!  

                Can't go wrong with tacos here and sandwiches... Yes there's a Hispanic dude making he tacos and a Asian lady making the sandwiches  

                I really like the sandwiches and the fact that they're so cheap makes it more delicious. It's a real gem and I recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a flavorful cheap sandwich.  

                This place is the BEST!  After reading reviews and being referred by several people, I finally tried it, and boy was it delicious!  It was hard to decide what to get because they have so much good stuff.  I went with the Banh Mi (Vietnamese Sandwich) and it was one of the best I've ever had.  I also tried the shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce and they were perfect and very fresh!  Decided to eat there and they even brought us a free taco to sample.  Everything on everyone's plate looked delicious.  The owner Tony walked around to check on everyone and shared stories about his love and passion for good food.  Wonderful person!  I can't wait to go back and order something different, maybe the Shrimp burrito....yes, they sell Mexican food too.  This place is amazing!  A must try!  

                Such a hole in the wall place that has some Damn good food! The enthustiac man who makes the tacos loves his customer's and his craft and it shows. The ladies who work the counter are nice as well and are generally nice to deal with. Tacos for 1.25 each that are delicious, not greasy and full of meat. The sandwhiches and other items are great as well but I mostly get the tacos. Highly reccomend! The only reason I'm giving it 4 and not 5 is that some rather unsavory bums come in asking for money and they don't really do much to kick them out. I understand it's not their fault but paying attention to stuff like that would make me feel better.  

                What a great find!  We were just shopping for Thai grocery and just happened to be a couple of doors down but was hungry.  Stepped in and was immediately impressed by the simple menu.  We started with only only one sandwich but ended up getting 2 Tacos and a drink.  Totally unexpectedly the 2 tacos were free! And the best that they were totally delicious.  The tacos were rich and flavorful.  Juice can drip down the hand if not careful.  Sandwich was totally what we expected from an authentic place - bread was soft inside and crunchy outside.  Plenty of meat and just the right amount of sauce.    Definitely need to come back for more.  

                I finally decided to try this restaurant out after my friend told me about it over a year ago. I don't know why I waited so long. Buy 3, get 1 free. The lady was pressuring me into buying 3 to get 1 free sandwich until I told her I only wanted a sandwich and tacos. The #1, Banh Mi was well stuffed with meat, veggies, and fresh bread. How much perfect can it get?  As for the tacos. I wanted cabeza but they were all out which I found hard to believe because it was not even lunch time. So I settled for lengua and al pastor. Lengua was very good and well cooked. Now, I was disappointed on the al pastor because it didn't taste how al pastor should taste like. It was still good but not the best. They did appear to get stingy on the meat for the tacos. The sauteed grilled onions and chile verde are a plus.  I also thought it was funny weird that when I was speaking to the Asian lady. There was Mexican music playing in the background.   Looking forward to trying the rest of their tacos.  

                Owned by Mexican & Vietnamese. Tacos, burritos and Vietnamese sandwiches?! Amazing. You would think that this is a weird combination, but actually the tacos are YUMMY!!!  Tacos are only a $1.25 each too! The Vietnamese sandwiches at this place is freshly made! Ridiculously cheap for a Vietnamese sandwich worth getting! Less than $3 each! Ssoo frreeaakkinngg cheap & yummy!!   The tacos were on the house, because they found out that it was me and my boyfriend's first time going to this place. At the end of our meal, they even gave us slices of watermelon! Wow. Great customer service.  Everybody here greeted every single person that walked in an out.  Also, they keep the cleanliness of the deli.  It's located in a little plaza, so there is a parking lot. The parking lot does get packed though. You can park on the side streets if you can't find parking in the plaza.  I am so coming here more often! Especially, if I want to have a Vietnamese sandwich that day!  You must come here at least once in your life! WORTH IT!!  

                1. Best tacos the the world, period. So flavorful and SPICY!!!  2. The owner Tony is the nicest and sweetest person ever. He's so passionate and proud of his food (and he has every reason to be). Lunchin' here was like private dining because we kept trying different things - nothing disappointed.  3. Just.... So goooood...  

                This place is the bomb. Food is crazy cheap like 3 bucks for a sandwich. They only take cash here, and it's kind of hard to understand what they're saying, but for 3 bucks what could go wrong?  

                I can never decide whether to get a taco or a banh mi...so I usually end up getting both.  Where else can you get a choice between Mexican food and Vietnamese food and have both options be so good?!  

                Husband is big into Thai cooking right now (Andy Ricker is his current hero Chef) so we spent the day checking out a few of the Thai markets in Oakland - recommended by you Yelpers of course - and happened upon this little dump in a tiny strip mall on the corner of 14th and International. When I say dump, it's said with affection (but it is a dump ;). The sign said Saigon Deli & Mexican Taqueria, how much more confusing can you get?  Right next to a laundromat, we just wanted to peek in the door just out of curiosity. Tony, the owner and in charge of the Mexican side, waved us in saying "welcome, welcome!" I'm a really big fan of banh mi so how we could say no? The woman at the counter, Wing, Tony's wife and in charge of the Vietnamese side, took our order after we choose from the giant menu above her head. The Vietnamese choices are amazing: sandwiches, rice plates, spring rolls, etc., plus Mexican food: tacos, quesadillas, burritos. They'll even mix the menu for you and make say a burrito filled with Vietnamese ingredients. Sweet!  Not much in the way of ambiance and the bathroom, well, let's just say don't use it if it isn't an emergency. The parking lot out front is convenient and you can pretty much ignore the 15 minute time limit signs if you are actually shopping in one of the stores. Just as we got our sandwiches, BBQ pork ($2.75 each), Tony comes out with two sample tacos. Really authentic and really delicious!  I like that most of the people coming and going seemed to be regulars and nearby business owners who were all known by name. The sound of voices speaking Spanish and Vietnamese at the same time was quite a delight to the ears too. If we are ever in East Oakland again, this will definitely be a stop. Go say hi to Tony and Wing!  

                The turn up is real!!! Came in wanting a BBQ pork sandwich and I left with six tacos. My wife ended up having the BBQ pork sandwich which was also very good and generous for the price. While I looked over the menu, the owner offered a free taco. Tried the taco ,which was delicious and I was sold.  Make sure to bring some cash! I will definitely be back to try their other items.  

                Sweet pork banh mi is so damn tasty you should be kicking yourself for not going out and getting one immediately!  Great value, two banh mi sandwiches, a taco, and two drinks for less than $8. Top it off with an owner personally bringing out his special hot salsa (fantastic BTW) for the taco and to make sure we were enjoying everything was great.  

                Owners very nice must try the al pastor only bad have to say is went their and did not have buche but. owner said if not made and prep  right rufuse to sell very understanding and caring a small hidden restaurant a must goto try ....Also free sample Al pastor taco on the   house..  

                Ba Le is still on top, but this place comes next in my book. This place has 2 major advantages over Ba Le, however: 1) parking lot 2) open til 7pm (versus Ba Le which closes at 6pm)  Sandwiches are hecka cheap, $3 or less, and they serve Mexican food! Best combo one can ask for. I have yet to try the Mexican cuisine, but next time, I must. I ordered the BBQ chicken banh mi, which was good but not impressive. Some bites were dry and I wish there was more sauce and/or pickled radish, but still satisfied my hunger.  

                Really good combination of vietnamese and mexican food, with great service and really cheap! Next time I will bring my friends.  

                I just recently discovered this place and it's pretty awesome. Love that I can get fresh tacos and also grab a Bahn mo to go for later. The burritos are huge and really tasty. But I'll tell you what... I'd go back just to hang out and goof with the owner. He is one silly dude and his customer service skills is not lacking at all. Super friendly and happy. His spicy pork tacos are amazing.  

                Vegetarian bahn mi wasn't great .  Was bland and I stopped eating after I reached a hair in it.  For $3 it's probably worth the money, thou.  

                Must visit! Been here twice now, and it's consistent. At first I thought this was Vietnamese Sandwiches or Taqueria, but I asked today if they could mix some Pastor (marinated, roasted, AND sautéed pork) with their Banh Mi sandwich... Bingo! They'll serve a Vietnamese (BBQ pork) burrito if you want. My wife had the "camarones a la diabla" today, served in white rice and sliced French bread.   It's in Little Saigon neighborhood (between Lake Merritt BART and Fruitvale. Unassuming business owners, Wing heads up the Vietnamese goodness and Tony runs the taqueria meats. They've been welcoming and friendly on both visits. Chinatown used to be my go-to for sandwiches, but Saigon Cafe is making it authentic or fusion. Your choice.   Make the trip!  

                The food of both cultures was really good and really cheap.  The owners were also nice as hell.  Will definitely be coming back!  Portions are also generous for the price.  

                This place serves as a Viet sandwich AND Mexican place.. WUT? I really expected sub-par Mexican food because I feel like places should specialize but it seems like it's co-owned.  The viet sandwiches here are freakin DELICIOUS and better than any that I've had in SF (at $3.50 too, ha!) Loads of filling + pate + fresh bread.. yummmmmmmm can't go wrong. Now I don't have to venture as far to South Bay for a fucking delicious banh mi.  Surprisingly as me and the bf were sitting, ALOT of peeps came in for burritos/Mexican food.  Ha.. funny. WOULD DEFINITELY RETURN. Also helps that the two owners are really nice.  

                I knew I loved it the moment he talked about how the store brings the community together. Im all in for my community. It was my first time he gave me a free sandwich. His good omen points just skyrocketed!! For sure coming back to try the Mexican food.  

                You know the saying, "you get what you pay for"? This place is only half a $ sign.   Tip #1 before we start: BRING CASH!!! No cards accepted!  Well, does not really apply here since you get a lot more bang for your buck than any other Vietnamese sandwich place! If you plan to go, do get the #1 combo! For only $2.75, it's a great deal. However, if you buy 3, you get 1 free! (Skip the BBQ chicken--had one today, and only had half before reaching for a #1 combo).  For $8.25 after "taxes" (**cough** **cough**) you get 4 sandwiches! The cold cut combo (with the pate) is very, very good. If you need to or would like to feed a small army, this is definitely the place to go!  Tip: if you do plan to get a lot and do not plan to eat it within the next 30 minutes or so, ask for them to put the vegetables in a separate Ziploc bag. They'll do that for free! That way, you don't have soggy bread, and your friends and family won't complain that the sandwich is not good.  

                I've heard about this place from Anti-Ba Le folks. I was off work early, had to do laundry and didn't have lunch yet. What better way to try it than to have it for lunch. My rule of thumb for a new Banh Mi place is to either order the combo or pork cake sandwich. I went with the latter and while waiting for my sandwich, the male owner asked if I wanted to try a taco. I said no. What was I thinking?! Should have tried it since so many customers are raving about it.   The sandwich looked like any other Vietnamese Sandwich. The pickled daikon and carrots were cold! That's a bonus point in my book because it was kept crunchy and the "banh mi" smell wasn't as overpowering. The pork cake and bread was like any others I've had. I mean it looks the same as a Ba Le sandwich. BUT! It was so well proportioned and seasoned and the way it was put together, every bite was perfect! I'm not even exaggerating. My problem with Ba Le and Cam Huong is that they overdo it with the mayo or the pickled veggies, I assume to cut their cost on meat, and it is just too much. I find myself scraping excess mayo off my sandwich at Ba Le and taking out more than a handful of pickled daikon at Cam Huong. This place was perfect for my taste cause I know people who ask for extra mayo or pickled veggies on their sandwich. It's just simply better than Ba Le and Cam Huong to me.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it doesn't have pre-packaged food like bun thit nuong, com op la bi, and goi cuon etc., like Ba Le and Cam Huong. You can order it and have them bring it out to you. Sometimes when you're in a rush, just running in to grab those for a quick lunch is really convenient. They can also do with tidying and brightening the place up a bit.   All in all, I am looking forward to trying other sandwiches and tacos and burritos there!  

                Super cheap, very tasty. Definitely making another trip here. I feel I can't write a full review because they were out of carnitas, and ship for the shrimp for the seafood plate but what I did have was slammin'. The carne asada tacos and pastor tacos along with the sweet beef Vietnamese sandwich. My phoned in order was 9 tacos and that sandwich for $15 out the door. Nice deal!  

                I agree with all the other reviewers. This place is awesome. Being new here we were gifted a couple free al pastor tacos. Tender, flavorful meat, no cheese/sour cream (thankfully) and some tasty salsa on top. We came here for Bahn Mi and were not disappointed. Bread was toasted just right, bbq pork was tender and nicely seasoned.   This is not a fancy place nor is it a place you want to run out of and eat in your car. There is ample seating and it's clean. Owners are friendly and happy you are there. And, as previously mentioned the price is way right.  We will be back!  

                Happen to find this place accidentally in 2012. Try to go weekly to get the best quesadilla I've ever had. I let everyone know about this hidden gem!  

                I came here for their banh mi's because it's a lot closer to home than Ba Le, plus parking is soooo much more convenient. I got a combo and 3 bbq pork sandwiches. I like that their bread is crispy and their peppers actually have a kick. What I didn't like so much was the radishes (the white stuff); it didn't seem fresh and wasn't crunchy. They could also use a little more of that mayo (I think?) and pate, it was a little bland.   Service was awesome! The lady kept insisting that I sample their Mexican items, but it was 9am when I was there... a little too early for that. I kept declining, but she insist!! So I told her I'll try it the next time. I got in and out in less than 5 minutes.  Overall, I would come back. Can't beat $2.75 a sandwich and it's buy 3 get one free! When you have to feed your starving siblings, it's the place to go.   Plus... I don't have to worry about hookers trying to attack me for my purse.  

                Buy 3, get 1 free??  HAIL YEAH!!!  From what I know, the owners are the same (or related) to the owners at Ba Le.  While I don't think Saigon Deli is as good, I feel like its ALMOST just as good.  I usually get the pork combo and it never disappoints AND it's cheap!  Be careful of the peppers though - they're extra hot here!  

                This is one of the best fast food places around! Love the viet-mex fusion! I've been here quite some time now and they don't disappoint. The owner guy is sooooo friendly and kind to the customers! He gives out free tacos sometimes, especially when it's your first time there! I love the friendly vibe he gives. It makes you wanna come back and thank him! Plus the food I've tried there so far is awesome!   - the BBQ chicken leg is huge sometimes. It's as big as my whole hand. It's tender and juicy and bit sweet.  - the vietnamese combination Sandwich. It has lots of flavors...not too salty like other places..but just right! Very tasty and cheap! $2.75! And it has just the right amount of ham/ pork party in it, along with the raddish and carrots and cilantro. Jalapeño is in it but u can ask to take it out.   - the pork torta sandwich. $3.75 I believe this is viet-mex fusion sandwich. It uses french bread like the viet sandwich, and has the Mexican marinated pork in it, with avocado, and other yummy stuffs. Definitely a must-try! I will post pix.  - the spicy pork tacos are so delicious! Very flavorful! Comes with a grilled onion and grilled jalapeño. Don't eat the seeds/ or inside of jalapeño; eat around it to avoid spicy :)  - avocado shake is pretty good too :)  This is one of my favorite places around and will definitely recommend to anyone! Call-in orders are pretty fast too.   By the way, CASH only. Perhaps the only thing that kinda sucks.
