                This is one of the best fast food places around! Love the viet-mex fusion! I've been here quite some time now and they don't disappoint. The owner guy is sooooo friendly and kind to the customers! He gives out free tacos sometimes, especially when it's your first time there! I love the friendly vibe he gives. It makes you wanna come back and thank him! Plus the food I've tried there so far is awesome!   - the BBQ chicken leg is huge sometimes. It's as big as my whole hand. It's tender and juicy and bit sweet.  - the vietnamese combination Sandwich. It has lots of flavors...not too salty like other places..but just right! Very tasty and cheap! $2.75! And it has just the right amount of ham/ pork party in it, along with the raddish and carrots and cilantro. Jalapeño is in it but u can ask to take it out.   - the pork torta sandwich. $3.75 I believe this is viet-mex fusion sandwich. It uses french bread like the viet sandwich, and has the Mexican marinated pork in it, with avocado, and other yummy stuffs. Definitely a must-try! I will post pix.  - the spicy pork tacos are so delicious! Very flavorful! Comes with a grilled onion and grilled jalapeño. Don't eat the seeds/ or inside of jalapeño; eat around it to avoid spicy :)  - avocado shake is pretty good too :)  This is one of my favorite places around and will definitely recommend to anyone! Call-in orders are pretty fast too.   By the way, CASH only. Perhaps the only thing that kinda sucks.
