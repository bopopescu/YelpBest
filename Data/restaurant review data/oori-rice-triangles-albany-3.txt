                I guess you get four stars Oori b/c I found myself getting off the freeway on my way from San Rafael to Oakland just to eat two rice balls. . . .and it was getting close to rush hour! I tried Oori last month for the first time and had the crab and was pleasantly surprised. I've gone to other rice ball places and been less impressed. This time I had the crab again and a short rib. Super tasty. There is attention to detail on seasoning their fillings. I guess for me that is the difference between here and Berkeley Bowl: You can't get crab with lemon aioli and chopped green onions, or warm succulent cubes of beef with just enough fat and char at Berkeley Bowl. Â And me too: two is just full. Three would be pushing it, but they do have a deal where you get more goodies if you order three . . . .
