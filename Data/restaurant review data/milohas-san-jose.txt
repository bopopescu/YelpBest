                This little gem of a place has been already getting so popular that they frequently sell out of all their stuff way before the end of the day.  Given this, I actually debated whether I should write this review since I didn't want to further blow up this secret go-to spot for us.  But the unselfish side of me ultimately prevailed.  So take advantage of checking this AWESOME place out.  From the savory cheese, chicken, beef or pork empanadas to the sweet dessert empanadas...they all rock.  They've also got a great selection of juices and ice cream to boot :)
