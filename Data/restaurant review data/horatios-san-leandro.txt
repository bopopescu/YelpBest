                I've been eating at Horatio's since the early 80's.  Being from San Leandro, this was one of the requisit places to have prom or pre-dance dinners.    Having said that, I still adore Horatio's.  While I do *wish* they still offered Beef Wellington, I'll accept the other wonderful menu choices they have added over the years.  I love the apps and drink menu and the wine offerings are great as well.  The restaurant is a bit dated, but it adds to the overall charm, and if you have been dining here for 30 years, it's like stepping back in time.    Was there most recently for our wedding anniversary and it was a perfect night with great food and wine, a complimentary Burnt Cream (to DIE for) and lovely service without being overbearing.  My favorite has to be the Caeser; I don't know how they make their dressing, but it's so tangy and yummy!  Scallops were on point (the breading, eh, but they were cooked perfectly) and the hubs raved over his short rib ravioli.    Never a bad meal or a bad time at Horatio's.  Will hopefully be dining here for another 30 years!
