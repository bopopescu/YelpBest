                Got the #37 vermicelli with egg rolls and pork. Very yummy, thin noodles. Thai tea is yummy but not the best I've had. Their dessert drinks are delicious however and full of jellies! I'd recommend any pho or vermicelli here, be careful with the spicy broths though- they are super spicy!! Be prepared for a wait, especially around dinner or lunch. Although you'll be behind a few people, the staff moves it along very fast
