                This was my first time at the Vacaville location.  My Mom wanted something sweet after my cousin's graduation lunch from UC Davis.  We ate at nearby Amicis, and Fenton's was a short walk.  However, I have been to the Piedmont Ave location in Oaktown many times after a movie.  I wasn't going to have anything, but a family member offered me half of their toffee almond caramel crunch.  One scoop is massive and costs $3.95.  I didn't want the food to go to waste, so I helped out (yeah right! - LOL!!!).  The ice cream was just as I remembered:  Rich and Satisfying.  We sat at the bench in the waiting area with other customers, and enjoyed the view of the Christmas tree.  The mango gelato put a smile on my Mom's face too, so it is hard to put a price on that:  4 Stars.  Fenton's might not be the best ice cream in the world, but every time I hear the name, or every time I have visited, it puts a smile on my face.  The only reason I didn't rate this location 5 Stars, is because I would reserve that rating only for the original location in Oaktown.
