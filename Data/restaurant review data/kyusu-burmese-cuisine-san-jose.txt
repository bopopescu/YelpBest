                Came for lunch with co-workers cause i've been eying this place for a while. I live fairly close and whenever i drive by there's usually a line outside...so it must be a good sign. We got there around 11:40a and there was no line. Granted it's the week of New Years so i'm sure people are out of town. But either way worked for us. We got seated immediately.. I got the pork noodle soup (i'm not even going to try and recall the official name). My co-workers got the fish noodle soup, coconut noodle soup, Burmese stir fried noodles and the aroma chicken. Everyone raved about their food. The picker eater in our group walked out of there very pleased about her choice and has stated that this would be a go to place. Everyone got complimentary soup before their meal (cabbage and glass noodles, there may have been chicken or pork in it as well. I can't recall) The staff was friendly and tried their best to explain how to eat the soups (make sure to add lemon or chilli).  Very pleased that the yelp reviews were pretty accurate and my hunch about seeing outside waits, meaning good food, was right. This place is a must return. I have my eye on the coconut noodle soup and the Burmese cake. We will see if a follow-up will change my rating...but i'm pretty sure it won't if the first experience was well received by everyone in the group.
