                Roli Roti is only at the Ferry Building twice a week but it's worth a visit. They are located outside the building so ask the information desk and they will point you in the right direction. It's a truck with a built in giant rotisserie with chicken and pork roasting along with potatoes on the bottom to absorb all the fat.  We had their famous porchetta sandwich. It's pronounced por-ket-ta by the way. Trust me I had to google it to be sure my fellow elite yelper JR C. was not full of shit.  The sandwich will run you almost $10 but it's large. I shared that with 2 other friends for a light meal and it was just the right portion. I like the combination of the pork meat and crispy skin along with the caramelized onions and arugula. The crispy skin really steals the show. I could eat just eat a bucket of the skin by itself. In fact, while we were waiting for our sandwich, the carver gave us a few pieces. They were heavenly.  I didn't have room for it but I would have liked to try the potatoes. They sit at the bottom of the rotisserie and get all the drippings from both the pork and the chicken. They sell them at $3 an order.
