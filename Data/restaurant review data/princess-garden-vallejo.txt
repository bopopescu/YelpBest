                I went to Princess Garden with relatives. We went for the Mongolian BBQ. They were quite accommodating, making sure there was room for a stroller and a high chair.   The meal started with the soup and some appetizers (egg rolls, mini drumsticks, etc). I usually bypass that and go straight for the meat (pork, beef, chicken and lamb). There's an assortment of veggies and sauces. I like that you make your own sauce combo- I like my food really spicy.  I also got some fried rice and potstickers from the tray. Not bad, since they were part of the buffet.   The second time I went up for bbq, I elected to go with the noodles. I was absolutely stuffed midway through the second bowl.   The waitstaff was very attentive, quickly refilling water glasses and removing dishes we were done with.  Overall, pretty good. I had been to this place numerous times over the last 20 years!
