                Happy Hour madness?  Bring it on.  But first you've gotta find the place, the most hidden of restaurants ever.  Even though I'd driven by the sign a million times over the years, never once had I even caught a glimpse of the restaurant, hidden as it is off East-bound Sir Francis Drake, just before you enter 101 South.  Okay, GPS it.    Word is that they have a pretty decent HH, 3 - 6 Monday thru Friday.  Also that they have a Wednesday ladies-who-like-ladies night.  I was there for HH on a Thursday night 'cause I like ladies, but not in that way.    For under $18, B and I downed:  * Rasberry Cosmo * Pomegranate Martini * Healthy Fries ($5)  I'm not even going to pretend these "fries" were healthy.  They were health-ish.  Fries crafted from green beans and broccoli florets, and served with two dipping sauces.  Delish.     Nice outdoor patio too.  Good HH find and quiet enough on a Thursday that low-decibal conversation was a breeze.
