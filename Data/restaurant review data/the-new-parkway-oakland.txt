                This was such a good experience! I don't go to the movies often, but when I do, I usually see them at smaller theaters like Shattuck in Berkeley (La-Z-Boy seats!!). A friend invited us to go see Obvious Child here a few days ago, and we decided to try it out, as we'd heard good things. It's a bit of a walk from Bart, but a quick trip down Telegraph on the 1. If you're driving, they offer free parking in the lot a block south of the theater.   Tickets are $6-$8 each, which is crazy cheap-awesome. They also have a ton of food and snacks on the menu, which you can bring straight into the theater! We got a couple slices of pepperoni pizza, and it was so delicious and nostalgic. The Bay Area seems to prefer either cardboard-thin or deep dish pizza, and this was right smack in the middle of that, which was refreshing. Their Italian sodas are $2 and yummy (I got a cherry one).  The theater itself has an adorable layout, stacked with funky couches and chairs throughout so groups can sit together in a living room-like setting. It was a really nice change of pace. The staff are super friendly and helpful, too.  Can't wait to come back!
