                I love this place! Their Torta Azada is sooo goood!  Every time my hubby and I order this, we always share because they are HUGE!  The Torta Azada are generously topped with meat, fresco cheese, jalapeno, avocado, and onions.  It hits my cravings every time.  Along with the Torta Azada, their Cubana is also good.  Not sure what all the ingredients included, but  I know ours had meat, sour cream, avocado, egg, hot dog, plus more.    In addition, I've also tried their donuts, sweet bread, and horchata drink.  The donuts and sweet bread were OK, I've tried better.  I'm not a fan of their horchata drink either.  It didn't taste like other horchata drinks that I've had, plus it had a grainy texture to it.  Other than that, I'd definitely come back for more of their torta!
