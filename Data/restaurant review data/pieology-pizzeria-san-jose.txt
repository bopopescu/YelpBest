                There's not many restaurants that make me feel super motivated to 1) sign on my computer [almost] immediately to make a review, 2) give it 5 stars, 3) make me want to go again, today, now, this second. I've been waiting FOUR-EV-ERRRRR (I do know how to spell forever) to get a chance to go to Pieology. It's always just been super busy. I think I've stopped by at least four times, all to find the line going around the whole restaurant. It begged the question, "what's so good about this place?"  Uh. Crispy crust. Loading it with tons of the good stuff (hi garlic!) and none of the weird stuff (kalamata olives, thats you). A great manager to help you build your pizza and get you swiftly on your way to pizza bliss.  Yes.  Love Love Love!  I stopped by this past Sunday with The Boy and we cheered because the line was only a few people long. I was nervous. Would I be able to construct a pizza of epic proportions? Yes. Because Mike was there. He pointed out putting the herbed garlic around the edges and putting marinara just in the middle...is the bomb. AND IT WAS. After that, I moved on to put mozarella, lots of shrooms, artichokes, garlic, bacon, pepperoni.   Then we waited. Like two minutes. How is it possible that such goodness comes out of that magic pizza oven so quickly??? It did. I wasn't disappointed. They even provide cute boxes because you know you want that pizza to last you at least a couple of meals.  I'm going to applaud the new manager (I truly believe it) for streamlining the process. I didn't see a line form of more than 5 people at a time. That's a Pieology miracle. I'LL BE BACK SOON!  Love you my herbed garlic crusty pizza.
