                Despite having read the reviews warning about how easy it was to miss Garaje, we still did.  In fact, my friends and I walked almost two blocks before realizing it.  Of course, that still wasn't as embarrassing as calling the place "gara-hey" (Spanish).  Instead of just, you know..."garage".  Or was I right?  I can't tell!  After walking in and checking out the menu, it's easy to see where their name comes from - an auto garage theme with menu that has a distinct Mexican tilt.  To be more precise though, I'd say it's San Diego-Mex - food served California style with fries and guac/avocados, a variety of fish tacos, and, of course, CARNE ASADA FRIES!  **Apologies in advance for the dark photos; I didn't want to use the flash...  -- NICO'S CHIPS WITH FIRE ROASTED SALSA...$3 (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/garaje-san-francisco?select=g8oVt4BqdO8SSBQ7l-ijNA#vEZGQzwmLCt0SK2hFRo2VQ">yelp.com/biz_photos/gara…</a>) The thick and crunchy chips were fantastic, but I was really impressed with the salsa.  It had a good amount of heat/spice that wasn't over the top, and a nice, smokey flavor.  While chips and salsa may be free at other places, I'd gladly pay for these!  -- CARNE ASADA FRIES - Skirt Steak Asada, Jack, Guac, House Salsa...$8 (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/garaje-san-francisco?select=g8oVt4BqdO8SSBQ7l-ijNA#dnLaIfiw0Nn6CkjENR3Hdw">yelp.com/biz_photos/gara…</a>) The one thing I had to try!  Not only was there a generous amount of carne asada (as well as guac), but the meat was juicy and flavorful as well.  San Diego has better to offer, and there could have been more cheese, but these were still great!  -- CALI STEAK ZAPATO...Skirt Steak Asada, Jack Cheese, Fries, Avocado, and Pico de Gallo...$8 (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/garaje-san-francisco?select=g8oVt4BqdO8SSBQ7l-ijNA#5vf-1WtzSjew4O2VYa_-yQ">yelp.com/biz_photos/gara…</a>) I agreed with my friend that it's similar to Taco Bell's Grilled Stuffed Burritos, but Garaje is so much better.  I loved how all of the delicious flavors literally blended together.  My only regret is not getting the carnitas version for variety's sake.  If I were to mention of the minor quibbles I had, it'd be that the kitchen was a little slow, there aren't a lot of tables for large groups, and that it's CASH ONLY.  At the same time though, the fantastic food, friendly workers, slew of hot sauces, and awesome beer selection more than compensate for any shortcomings.  Also, while their main items are listed on the board by the register, make sure to take a look at the paper menu as well.  Not only is it a little easier to read, but there's also a "secret" menu that's not listed on the wall.  Ultimately, it may not alter what you decide to order, but it certainly gives you reasons to come back!
