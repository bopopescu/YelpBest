                My wife had a green curry and I went with the panang curry - both were excellent! The meat was good quality and we both got a lot of vegetables, all of which were fresh and delicious.   The ordering was not the smoothest but the food showed up after 20 minutes or so. Hard to beat! Good price as well.  

                DELIVERY REVIEW ONLY. Wow. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered crab rangoons, chicken skewers, and the grilled pork plate. My order came within 33 minutes. The delivery guy was very polite as well. (+2 stars)  My food was piping hot. The rangoons had plenty filling with REAL dungeoness crab meat in it. The chicken skewers (4) were juicy and tender w/thick, creamy peanut sauce on the side. The grilled pork plate was plentiful and flavorful. Tender pieces of pork, tangy mango salad, and I LOVE sticky rice. (+3 stars) Overall, I was impressed w/April Nine and will try other options next time!  

                Ordered over the phone and the entire time I had to repeat myself about 3 times about everything as she tried to rush me without actually listening. Order was late by 30 min. and I called again with her telling me it was on the way and hung up.   Food wise:  * Disappointed about the proportions for what I paid. * It however tastes pretty good.  

                Food: 5/5  Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 2.5/5   I feel like this area for location is a bit .. "sketchy" because of the neighborhood it's in. Hidden away from the nearby main street 19th Ave, this place offers some pretty good Thai food! The restaurant itself doesn't look all that great; looks like it was previously a taqueria, but I feel like the restaurant probably didn't have much to start with. I think they need to add some more decor on the walls. Though it's not that great looking inside or out...the restaurant tries to makes it feel as welcoming as possible. If you don't want to be in the area, they do delivery, but I'm not sure how far they would go.   The servers are friendly, but the only off thing I didn't like during my time there was that we sat next to these arches, by the front counter. When they came to give us our drinks and food, instead of making their way around the wall of arches, they would give us our drinks and food through the window of the arch. It made it seem like they were a bit lazy to go around.. If that's the case, I think they should make the effort of going around because it's more personal between the server & customer, or take down the arch.   The food here is pretty darn good! I would probably come back to do some take outs.  Had the Dungeness Crab Rangoon ($8) and it was delish! Highly recommend to order this as appetizer.   I read from a previous review that crispy pork belly & pumpkin curry were a good mix; but they don't have crispy pork belly anymore! :( Got the beef pumpkin curry ($9) instead and it was still pretty good. The dish itself came with rice on the side and pumpkin inside the curry.  My bf ordered the grilled pork rice plate ($10) and it came with a side of mango salad. Had a bite of his dish, and everything was pretty good too! --basically their food is delicious & good!   A can of coke is $2! From another reviewer, they said if you place an order through EAT24, there's usually a $2 off coupon .. which means you can use it for the soda lol.   Recommend for take out, but probably not for sitting in cause it looks sorta sketchy in the area..  

                I placed an order through EAT24 (usually there's $2 off = free soda). I'm actually 4 blocks away but like the convenience of delivery. Placed my order around 7pm and it came in about an hour, right before my hangry kicked in!   I got the pad see ew with seafood. There's was plenty of calamari but only 2 prawns :(. But it was pretty good. Definitely would order again. I love Thai food but I'm allergic to peanuts. It's great to know they follow special instructions and left of the nuts.vAlso ordered the pad Thai with beef. No too bad. We order medium spicy and it felt like it was extremely mild. Nothing like good oil' siracha so to spice it up.  

                Random Thai restaurant tucked away in the Ingleside district of SF.  Don't let the exterior fool you, it does not look like a restaurant from the outside at all.  There are some bars by the window and can be mistaken for a liquor store or youth center, but I believe it was once a taqueria  However, once you walk in, you are welcomed by the aroma of sweet chilies and Thai spices.  Furniture and decor is a bit missed matched and if you tend to get cold easily, bring a jacket!    Exterior aside, service was welcoming and food was very authentic.  Their lychee duck curry + pork belly were probably my 2 favorite dishes out of the 5 that we ordered.  Distinctively different w/ a hint of sweetness from the lychee, it made the spiciness from the curry a bit more tolerable.  When they tell you dishes are spicy, they're not kidding.  We ordered most of our dishes "mild" but man, there was still a kick!  Be patient and don't expect the food to come out right away though.  We got here at the peak of dinner time (6:30 - 7pm) and due to the high demands of the phone orders they must cater to, there was a bit of wait.     Not sure if I'll return for a dine-in visit, but I'll definitely be ordering take outs from here more often.  

                I stopped by for a late dinner, an hour prior to the restaurant's closing. We found parking right out front. There was no one eating at the restaurant, but it seemed that there were more pick-up and delivery orders.  The restaurant itself is very open with a decent amount of seating and group tables. The open kitchen is the first thing you see upon entering April Nine Thai.   After perusing the menu, we ordered:  -Baby back ribs: Tender ribs glazed in a thick savory sauce, accompanied by a simple but refreshing cucumber salad and steamed rice. My favorite dish of the night.   -Duck noodle  soup: A large bowl of soup consisting of rice duck, rice noodles, bean sprouts, and green onion. While the duck was  tasty, I thought there could have been more of it. Unfortunately, the broth was too salty.  -Pad kee  mao with beef: Good, standard pad kee mao. It was a bit spicy and included cherry tomatoes that just burst in your mouth.  Service was efficient but wasn't as friendly as expected.  

                Food was excellent at a reasonable price.  I ordered Pad Se Ew and Red Lychee Duck Curry. Both items were very tasty - highly recommend the Lychee Duck Curry, very unique set of flavors w/ sweet Lychee.  I ate the meal at the restaurant which was clean but very plain and run down. I would definitely go back but probably only for take out.  

                Came here unplanned bec Tani's Kitchen was full. I will come back here for sure! Here's why:  - place is clean and spacious - the hostess is friendly and customer-service oriented - happy hour between 5pm-7pm (and we came around this time!) - restroom is clean  - food is fresh and oh-so-tasty! - I love an open kitchen!  

                I placed an order for delivery and I wasn't impressed. I was on hold for about 5-10 minutes, while the hostess would periodically check in with me, then place me on hold again.  It took about an hour for my order to arrive, which was fine if my food would've been delivered warm. I had ordered the pad thai and it was fairly cold with super thin spaghetti like noodles. And, they forgot the hot sauce!   The only thing that made this order worth it was the thai iced tea.  

                I gave in and decided to give them a second chance since I was starving and they're so close my house.   I ordered the grilled chicken with rice for to-go, and they did not give me the sauce for the chicken! And I know for sure it's supposed to come with sauce because I've ordered grilled chicken many times.  First they forget to give me rice... And now they forget the sauce?! April Nine and I are just not meant to be.  

                Decent spot.   First time I ordered here I would have given it a 1 or 0 rating if possible. I ordered Pad Kee Mao to-go and when I looked at it I knew immediately that it wouldn't be very good. The noodles were bunched up in a solid mass and very, very oily. The meat (chicken) was okay, but not 'good' - in fact the only good part was the vegis, which were actually very fresh and just the right amount of crisp for the dish. The sauce was all wrong, it just didn't taste like Kee Mao at all.  Tried a second time, and followed some advice here on yelp and got the pumpkin curry and I was not disappointed. It was delicious! It's now pretty much a go-to comfort food (its a bit carb-heavy with all the pumpkin chunks and rice) for me because I live in the area. I've tried some of the other dishes (not any noodle ones though) which turned out pretty good, but pumpkin curry is definitely the best choice on the menu.  Overall, it's A-OK - just do like me, and avoid the noodle dishes altogether and you will probably have a tasty experience.  

                I have been a yelp user since 2005, but have never been compelled to write a review until now.   My girlfriend and I have given this place a 2nd, 3rd, and 4th chance since the reviews are so good but are constantly let down:  Here's the deal:  IF you are a diner who appreciates fresh ingredients, rich, exciting flavors, and more than 5 or 6 small pieces of chicken in your chicken pad thai, this is not the place for you.    If you are reading yelp reviews because you recently moved to the area and are trying to find some diamond in the rough, "family recipe" Thai restaurant this is definitely not it, don't waste your time and money.    -but-  IF you are the type of diner that finds safeway roasted chicken out of this world, doesn't use salt then they cook at home, and drowns their food in condiments, they offer pretty good portions sizes for the money.   If you are ordering take out, please note they haven't analyzed their procedures for this in a very long time, and the food doesn't travel well at all.  I advise taking everything out of the containers and reconstituting it in a pot or pan.  This sounds unusual I know, but will help to alleviate your disappointment when your food arrives.  Lastly, do not take the other reviews mentioning the "F-You" customer service attitude lightly, this is very real.  

                My boyfriend and I can be big couch potatoes so we had a tendency to order take-out often. We ordered from this place once out of curiosity.   I can't remember the savory food that we ordered at all but my boyfriend tells me we didn't like it at the time. I'm going to have to order from them again to verify that.   The weird part is that we order from April Nine A LOT....but for the dessert. Both the green tea creme brulee and the mango sticky rice.  The green tea creme brulee is like your usual creme brulee but with a slight matcha flavor. Not enough for my taste but enough to keep me hooked.   The mango sticky rice is beautiful! They present this dish pretty nicely for take out! The mango is usually consistently juicy and the rice is buttery and mildly sweet with a hint of coconut. Everything is accented with toasted seeds (idk what) and mint but I have only eaten the seeds.  They seem to have updated their dessert list so I AM SO EXCITED TO TRY MORE!  

                Tried the crispy soft shell crab rice plate today. Fried rice was okay nothing special, but crispy soft shell crab was quite disappointing, lacking crispness and flavors described in the menu.  

                Probably one of the most awful and unpleasant places I have ever had to deal with. After having my delivery be two hours late, the driver felt it was necessary to write a tip on my receipt without my knowledge. Oh and there were two hairs in my "fresh rolls  

                I ordered pickup tonight and my pad Thai was inedible. The noodles tasted of nothing and the chicken was scarcely 3 pieces which had no flavor! I looked at the chicken and it was white as could be, as if they hardly put any flavoring on my noodles and threw in some cut boiled chicken that couldn't absorb anything to which my pad Thai tasted of nothingness.  I am so disappointed. Especially since I had came there before and decided it was fantastic and today my past judgement seemed to be questioned, hard. I hope the business reads my review to get their food to being more consistent that way clients can come back to the same great food and not leave in utter regret.   Thanks for the try April Nine but I'll come back when the food is more consistent.  

                We wanted  a quick dinner near SFSU and this fit the bill.  ON a Sunday night, we were the only folks in the restaurant at 7:30pm so that was worrisome.  NO need to be worried  - delicious Thai!  We had the spring rolls which were fresh and served with the typical sweet sauce.  Then I had the seafood noodle soup which was SPICY but I liked it. I couldn't have handled it any spicier, so it was right on that border, but good.  Also ordered was the spicy chicken on their 'specials' menu. It was ground chicken with some bell peppers. It was too spicy for me to eat but my friend really liked it.  I'd like to go back and try a few more things.  

                My boyfriend and I have been ordering regularly from April Nine for a while now, and we love the food (so two stars for that). But the service leaves a lot to be desired, and last night in particular was so bad that they lost us as customers.  When we order for pickup, the service is usually quick. We can often pick up our food in just 15 minutes. But when we order for delivery, usually through EAT24, it usually takes an hour or more to arrive. This is strange because it's nearly always dead inside when we come to pick up, so they can't be THAT busy, but I digress...  We both had particularly long days yesterday, and decided to order from April Nine for delivery, and got a confirmed 75 minute delivery time. Really long, but we were exhausted and willing to wait.   After 90 minutes I called. The girl on the phone asked for my name and address and then told me the food was on the way. To me that meant in a car on its way to our house, so we expected the food in the next 10 minutes. They must've be having a busy night, fine.  Another 30 minutes go by, and I call again. The same girl asks for my name and address again, and tells me the food is on the way. Then I started to get angry, because at this point - 1 - it had been almost two hours since we first ordered - 2 - they were closing soon - 3 - we had already paid for our food - 4 - this girl didn't seem to have any idea what was actually going on.  She took my number and called me back after another 10-15 minutes. She tells me the order had never been printed, so they hadn't even started making it yet. After she had told me TWICE that it was on the way. She proceeded to apologize very insincerely and ask if we wanted to cancel the order or wait 45 more minutes (making it a whopping 3 hours) for our food. At that point I think we deserved the meal for free, which wasn't offered. So I cancelled and hung up. Never again.  So at 10pm, 3 hours after we attempted to order some food on an already exhausting day, we were left dinnerless and out of options. Thanks for the stellar service, April Nine.  Now looking for other good Thai restaurants in the area.  

                Wanted to have quick Thai food and found this place on yelp.  My bf and I arrived and we both were like....should we go inside??  Seriously it was very ghetto from looking outside.  It doesn't look like a restaurant; more like a small church.    The decor was very empty, weird and COLD.    I was wearing my jacket the whole entire time.    The staffs were very friendly thou but kinda slow because they had a lot of take out orders.  I think people preferred to take out because of the weird dining area.    The food was actually pretty good.  All the dishes that we ordered were done well.   We ordered:  Chicken Satay - the meat cooked very well and flavorful.  The peanut sauce was tasty too.    Pumpkin Curry with Prawns - The prawns were fresh.  The curry was flavorful but kinda watery.  The pumpkin was little undercooked but overall it was still good, especially with the rice.    Garlic Pork - The pork was very good.  Cooked well and flavorful.  The portion was just good.   Sticky Rice with Mango - The mango was sweet.  The sweetness of the sticky rice was prefect but the rice was little overheated.  So the edge was little hard.   Overall, the food was good but just the location was little off.....  

                The food here is amazing. Had the bbq pork ribs and the Tom yum soup, the best!!! Tastiest Tom yum soup ever!!! And it's so close to my house. Staff is great too!  

                I often order for pickup since I live pretty close to here. Fried rice and April tai pasta is my favorite. Don't ask them to make your food spicy if you can't take spicy food well. Spicy means Super Spicy for them.  

                Actually a very good deal for a Thai place, which is refreshing. They don't serve alcohol but there is a liquor store next door & you can BYOB.  

                Delivery service is excellent. What I always order Crispy pork belly w/green beans - x spicy Pumpkin curry  I live a mile away from this place. Never dined in. Its faster when you call. Takes about 30-45 mins. I have used eat24 or yelp to get a delivery since they send me a coupon. It took at least an hour to get my food.  

                I was craving curry and not wanting to cook so I decided to try this place out.  The delivery was fast and the service was very friendly.  However, I ordered my red curry very spicy, and specified that twice in the online order form, yet it was completely mild.  I did not see or taste any spicy peppers at all.  I was very disappointed.  It was really sweet though, so if you like sweet, mild curry it may be good to order.  My roommate ordered the pad kee mao and was satisfied with it.  

                I live only a half mile away and decided to order take out using the eat 24 app. it was simple, quick and also an efficient way to pay. I ordered the lychee duck curry and delicious!  I like my food extremely spicy so i was surprised that i didnt have to add any more hot sauce since i ordered it very spicy. The curry had a rich savory and creamy flavor and the pieces of duck melted in mouth. The lychee added a sweet pop to the dish and it was the first time that i had lychee with curry. I will definitely be ordering from here again and excited to try more of their menu  

                My 1st time dining here, everything I ordered (except the peanut sauce) was dry and disappointing.   When I called the restaurant, the woman who answered the phone offered me a credit for my order. Once I try this place again, I'll revise my review.  

                Unbelievably great. I was hesitant to go in because of the outside look  but when I went in , very clean  had a 100 at the door. The food was very tasty and full of flavor. I was so impressed that I will be coming back.  

                In the 2 months my boyfriend and I have lived in San Francisco, we have ordered from April Nine Thai Kitchen four times, each time ordering something different.  Every time the food has been delicious and the service excellent.  I recommend the Crab Rangoon and the April Thai Pasa. Delicious!  April Nine loses a star because the delivery is almost always late.  

                I think the 4.5 is a fair rating. I came here with a friend and we were both able to find street parking in the area without too much trouble. We were getting a fairly late dinner.  When we entered around 8:30pm and it was fairly empty. By the time we ordered food, we were the last patrons there. We were served water without even asking - something I can appreciate.  We glanced over the menu without being rushed or bothered. As soon as we were ready, I looked up, and the waitress came over and took our order. They have a special where you order 3 a la carte dishes, and you get free soup and dessert!   Spicy Mushroom and Tofu Soup - I actually enjoyed this much more than I expected. The broth wasn't over flavoured nor was it bland. It wasn't very spicy, but you can tell that it has a nice kick. The bowl had a lot of mushrooms and tofu! This hot soup was very very enjoyable on a cool day.  Crispy Pork Belly App - I didn't actually read the menu, so I don't know what this dish was actually called, but it was a delicious crispy pork belly. The pork bellies were cut a bit small, but it's somewhat better for sharing with people I guess. I personally enjoy larger cuts with a crispy outside and a tender inside. I enjoyed the flavouring of this. The fresh basil, leafy greens, and red bell peppers was a nice combo.  Red Pumpkin Curry with Beef - I felt like this was a fairly standard red curry, maybe a little better than standard. It wasn't exceptional, nor did it stand out. The bowl of curry is fairly large... the portion size of this was huge, so +1 for that! Definitely for sharing between two people. This place gives a lot of meat and veggies, and that's a good thing!  Three Musketeers - This is a seafood dish with shrimp, scallops, and a single mussel cooked in a spicy broth with onions and basil. This dish was pretty good too. Seafood isn't always the easiest to cook. Everything was just a little bit overcooked, but I don't blame them. This is a 10/11ish dollar dish. Could have given us two mussels though.  Green Tea Creme Brulee - If you have not read my other reviews, I don't have a big sweet tooth. The first bite of this forced me to finish my water. I thought it was too sweet. My friend then ate most of the carmelized sugar off the top and removing some, and when I just ate the green tea creme, it was much much better. Just a personal preference though.   Mango Sticky Rice - This dish was more along my lines. It wasn't overly sweet. The mango was good (not necessarily the best / most ripe or anything). I think a not quite ripe mango is best for this kind of presentation. It maintained some tartness which I enjoyed. This paired with the sticky rice balanced out nicely.  Service was very attentive and friendly. It really makes a difference when people smile. Our waitress smiled the whole time even though it was the end of the day.   Our total came to about 34ish, even though the soup and dessert were free. Ouch. The food was good and the portions were good. Definitely could have had another person help us with this food and still be full. Ideally, this place is perfect for a small group of 3-5. There is plenty of seating too!   Ahh, almost forgot, there's no alcohol here!   So all in all, 4.5 is a fair rating and I had a few very very minor qualms which I think amount to half a star.  I would return, and I would definitely recommend this place!  

                I recently had a holiday party and had food delivered to the site. My party enjoyed the appetizers but they where on time, set up And The price was fantastic. Thank you. Will definitely use them again  

                I would give this place a 4-star rating (as I am definitely a fan), however bug nuisance was a problem. They have no screens on the windows and left the huge door open. It was a warm night, so I can understand wanting the draft. However, me dodging huge flying bugs throughout my meal + large flies hovering around just makes the already empty dining room more depressing.  First of all, this place is dead. They seem to get most of their business through delivery/pick up orders, because although my boyfriend and I were their only table (aside from another solo diner who came after), we still waited a good 30 minutes from when we were seated to getting our first dish/appetizer.  Now onto some GOOD news. They have a GREAT Happy Hour Menu (5pm-7pm DINE IN ONLY) with some good staples.  ~$3.50 MINI PLATE~ Chicken Satay Skewers (3) Crispy Roll Thai Puff  ~$6.50 MEAL DEAL~ CHICKEN OR VEGGIE ONLY Thai Fried Rice Spicy Basil Cashew Chicken or Tofu Pad Thai Pad See Ew Pad Kee Mao Kua Gai  ~$6.50 VEGGIE DEAL~ Chinese Broccoli Eggplant Basil Mix Veggie  ~$1.50 Drink~ Thai Iced Tea Thai Iced Coffee Jasmine Green Iced Tea  We had: - Chicken Satay Skewers: Very tasty. Came with Peanut dipping sauce and some pickled cucumbers. - Pad See Ew with Prawns: Boyfriend said it was too salty, but I thought it was delicious at 12am with munchies - Pad Kee Mao with Chicken: I thought this was great, and for the happy hour price it was definitely worth it. - Red Pumpkin Curry with Chicken Rice Plate: Wish they put more pumpkin pieces and less bamboo shoots. I feel like these dishes are misnamed. I wish it had more pumpkin flavor than just cubes of the cooked vegetable. Taste like any generic red curry with just cubes of pumpkin in it. -Thai Iced Tea: Like from any other place. However, I applaud them for not having 3/4 of the cup filled with ice.  SERVICE: Not terrible, but nothing to write home about. I can appreciate how the server ALWAYS replenished our water glasses without having to call her over. She did check up on us to see how everything was, but a smile wouldn't kill her. As previously stated, it took 30 minutes from the moment we sat down to get our first dish. Something like chicken skewers shouldn't take that long.  I would definitely be back for their happy hour pricing (but not alone! the area is kind of sketch...)  

                This is the second time that I've called in for delivery at April Nine Thai Kitchen. This is also the second time they gave me coffee instead of thai tea. I have NO idea why. But whatever. I'm starving.   When I called, the lady was polite and told me the order will be ready in 50 minutes. The driver was ON TIME. It was literally at 50 minutes as I was walking downstairs to get the order. The driver was the nicest man ever! The food is so good, mangoes salad was fresh, so was the honey grilled pork, it was tender and sweet, the sauce that came with was SPICY but oh soooooo good. The sticky rice was meh. Not the best but everything else is great. I will most definitely continue to order for delivery. I'll even drop by the place next time to try out the environment there.   Minus .5 stars for the drink, and another .5 for the meh sticky rice in the foil wrapper.  Update 01/31/15: the place is nice the location is not so much. You can tell this used to be a Hispanic shop which is pretty cool. I like the design but it threw we off since this is a thai restaurant. The kitchen is completely out in the open with the dining area so you can see how they run, and it is pretty clean from what I saw.   I can see why the delivery or pick up is so much more desirable since the neighborhood isn't great. There were multiple times when an individual would come to our car and look inside, we had to go out there and let it be known we were watching the car. Needless to say, we packed out stuff and ate at home. Also the portions are tiny when dining in! I'm definitely keeping this place under the delivery only belt. I'm also keeping the rating at 4 stars. -0.5 for the weirdo trying to break into our car at 6pm and -0.5 for the tiny dining in portions.  

                This is my go to spot for delivery. The food has been consistently good and tasty, but I feel like they skimp on ingredients a lot. Most recently I ordered the curry noodles with bok choy and chicken to find they put 2 tiny pieces of bok choy and about 4 tiny pieces of chicken. Same thing with the chicken noodle soup and the silver noodle salad I ordered: hardly any chicken. Flavors are always great though, some of my favorites are the Grilled Pork, Summer Rolls, Pad Kee Mao, and the Prik Khing Green Beans. Their vegetables always taste really fresh and blanched perfectly! I will continue to be a customer here.  

                Holy Cow! I have lived in Ingleside for 5 years now. I remember when this restaurant was a shady mexican pizza place with no customers that my friends and I were pretty sure was a front for a meth lab. It has blossomed into a gorgeous restaurant.  The atmosphere and decor is wonderful. The food is so good. In this  culturally vapid section of the city this place is a delicious diamond in the rough. They have the best yellow curry I have ever tasted. Prices are resonable and they have a great happy hour.  

                TERRIBLE ! I ordered delivery and the food was two hours late. There was a hair in my fresh rolls and my food was cold. I did not leave a tip on the receipt and so the delivery guy put in a tip amount without my permission and I only found out by looking at my bank statement!!!! never again  

                The red pumpkin curry here is fantastic! Probably the best I've ever tried. The Tom Yum soup and the Pad Thai was ok... But I mostly just like this place for the pumpkin curry. Service was ok. It was in a sketchy area but in the inside, it was pretty cute with the interior designs. I've also tried the mango sticky rice. It was yummy and perfect for dessert. The jasmine green tea is so addicting. I usually just call for delivery since it's free if you order more than $15!  

                This place is the bomb dot com ( does anybody ever use that phrase anymore). I remember going here when it first open and truthfully I was kind of hesitant- the exterior doesn't look like anything extravagant but the food makes up for it. All the times I have gone, I have ordered the eggplant with tofu dish. All three or four times I have loved it. I also recently found out they have a happy hour from 5-7 Mon-Fri, which means I will be there everyday ( I don't take the phrase starving student lightly haha). the happy hour plates are a bit smaller than you normally would get but for the price I'm ok with that and I love have the thai tea is only $1.50 if you go to HH.  

                This is an amazing place. The staff is friendly and the food is great, I also really like the ambiance. Price is reasonable. This is a true hidden gem in the area. Highly recommend,  

                This is most definitely one of the top Thai places in the Bay Area. Yeah I said that. We're pretty picky when it comes to Thai good because there are so many options and we've been to so many of them... and it's pretty hard to screw up Thai. But April Nine is just a GEM. The location is terrible - middle of nowhere - basically a residential area in Daly City and the decor is pretty ghetto. There's almost NO ONE there most of the time (I beat people just do pick-up all the time) so seating is never a problem. But the food is just amazingly good. I can't believe people don't flock here.  The curries - thick and flavorful. A 9 across the board. Thai curries are almost universally too watery for me - hard to really carry the full range of flavor when it's so watery. But April Nine does it right. Meat quality is good. Veggies are not overdone.  I don't think I've had a Thai curry that's better anywhere in the Bay Area.  Honey grilled pork - a 9. I know it's kind of a weird dish to highlight on a Thai menu - it's practically Vietnamese - but it's really good. Don't get the sticky rice that comes with it (it's usually super dry and old) get it with just regular rice. It's super good. Puts Vietnamese thit nuong to shame!  Thai fried rice with the chicken cutlet - another wacky dish that just amazing here. The chicken cutlet is so so - but the fried rice is spectacular. I know weird right? Fried rice being amazing at a Thai place? For real.  Anyway, please don't spread the word TOO much about this place because they're basically going to be the go-to place for Thai food for a lot of people if they find out.
