                This is most definitely one of the top Thai places in the Bay Area. Yeah I said that. We're pretty picky when it comes to Thai good because there are so many options and we've been to so many of them... and it's pretty hard to screw up Thai. But April Nine is just a GEM. The location is terrible - middle of nowhere - basically a residential area in Daly City and the decor is pretty ghetto. There's almost NO ONE there most of the time (I beat people just do pick-up all the time) so seating is never a problem. But the food is just amazingly good. I can't believe people don't flock here.  The curries - thick and flavorful. A 9 across the board. Thai curries are almost universally too watery for me - hard to really carry the full range of flavor when it's so watery. But April Nine does it right. Meat quality is good. Veggies are not overdone. Â I don't think I've had a Thai curry that's better anywhere in the Bay Area.  Honey grilled pork - a 9. I know it's kind of a weird dish to highlight on a Thai menu - it's practically Vietnamese - but it's really good. Don't get the sticky rice that comes with it (it's usually super dry and old) get it with just regular rice. It's super good. Puts Vietnamese thit nuong to shame!  Thai fried rice with the chicken cutlet - another wacky dish that just amazing here. The chicken cutlet is so so - but the fried rice is spectacular. I know weird right? Fried rice being amazing at a Thai place? For real.  Anyway, please don't spread the word TOO much about this place because they're basically going to be the go-to place for Thai food for a lot of people if they find out.
