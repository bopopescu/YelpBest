                The atmosphere is excellent and they even greet you in Japanese. Although they forgot to bring out some stuff that we ordered and they took a long time to bring it out. Granted they were very busy so it's an easy mistake. The servers did a great job of asking us often how everything was.   It is a little pricey, but I think $34 is worth it if you order plenty of sushi and the higher quality stuff on the menu.   The waiter seemed like he was in charge of too many tables so maybe they should hire more people? But again, it was way busier than normal when we went.   Great fun. I recommend it. The sushi is great. (But not the chicken karange, it tasted frozen and simply a filler).
