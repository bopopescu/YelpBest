                Just went to this little gem last night. Cute spot, friendly employees, & very tasty food. I got the chicken gyro plate (sandwich style) w/rice. The fries are to die for!!! Also got the fresh donut holes sprinkled with cinnamon, powdered sugar, & syrup! It was pretty amazing. The only thing I would do different is get the yogurt sauce? On the side. A bit overwhelming for me. No complaints other then my personal issue. ;) Highly recommend it!!
