                I love this place so much! It's the best Vietnamese sandwich joint around the el Cerrito area. The bread is warm and crispy! The meats are tender and full of flavor!   Their BBQ chicken is one of the most popular items. Def try it if you've never been here. I usually get that or the number 1.   I love how they hollow out a little of the baguette so they can fit extra meat in the sandwich :) Â   Thanks Ba Le!
