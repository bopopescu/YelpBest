                I came here for a birthday meal and was able to sit in their nice outdoor dining area. Their decor is very modern and hotel-like and the outdoor area has ample seating. I tried three of their island tacos, two of which I thought were pretty good. One of them was uninteresting.   I also tried their agave margarita which was alright. Really this place is just alright. Nothing about the food was outstanding or finger-lick-inducing.
