                FINALLY visited Dish Dash last weekend & they did not disappoint! Got there on a Friday night around 6:30 and the place was packed. We put our name in & were told we'd get a text when our table was ready in about 20-30 min. so we decided to head to a bar across the street & have a drink. 30 min. later the text came & we headed over.   The place was still packed but the line was no longer out the door just to put your name in. I'd recommend reservations but if you don't mind waiting & bar hopping while you wait, no big deal.   I don't know what it's called but a dish of oil with some other stuff mixed in came to the table along with some pita slices. The pitas were good, the oil mix was just okay & I could do w/o it.  I ended up ordering: Sambusak Dajaj - diced chicken, mushrooms, almonds, onions in filo dough, spinach sauce, salata. It was FANTASTIC! You get 3 big filo triangles & I could only eat 1/2 of my meal after the pitas and drink so I took the rest home for lunch the next day.  I definitely would like to go back & try their falafel, shwarma & kebabs!
