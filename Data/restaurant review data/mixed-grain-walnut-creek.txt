                Love this restaurant. Let's be honest, this isn't the best Korean food I've ever had (that honor goes to my Grandma of course,) but here's what they get right:  Small informal place (but not tackily decorated like so many Korean restaurants I've been to... say this with love but no one wants Soju posters and Korean newspapers lining the walls), great service (the waitstaff speaks English for all the non-Korean patrons!), the menu is idiot-proof, the restaurant is clean (even the bathroom), the banchan is all well-flavored and they def keep it coming, prices are more than reasonable (yes, this place costs less than the cheap chain Tender Greens a block away) and the food is very well prepared and tasty. Here's where they pick up the bonus points: they have purple rice! Rare for most Korean restaurants!!! And they put a lil flag in your food to delineate who at the table had what dish. Love this. Â Will make this cute family run establishment a stop off every time im in WC!
