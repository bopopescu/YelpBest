                Lot's of low-carb options. Skewers were good. Price was very reasonable.  

                Ate here for Saturday night dinner with the parents after a recommendation from a family friend. Worst mistake ever.  Right when we opened the front door, I smelled that yakitori/grill smell--the small restaurant was FILLED with this bbq smell. If you're sensitive to smokey smells, I would advise you to bring a mouth mask--yes, it's THAT smokey. Arrived a few minutes after it opened at 6PM and the hostess immediately told us that we would have to finish eating by 7:30PM because of the next reservations. That was the first turn-off of the night! I understand you want to make money and maximize your sales, but keep that information to yourselves!   We sat at a small table next to a couple of large parties, and our server gave us some steamed towels to wipe our hands--that reminded me of my childhood days when airlines used to hand us warm towels on international flights! That was such a unique part of their service that made me smile. The room is very small, I'd say with a max occupancy of less than 50 people. During dinner time, the atmosphere can even be described as romantic/intimate, but we had little kids in between our table so the environment was quite family-friendly.  Food-wise, we started off with the daikon mochi balls (friend's recommendation), grilled squid, and sashimi salad. After we realized that the plates were on the smaller size, we told another server we wanted a bowl of ramen as well. The Japanese food here is legit, I will hand it to Ajito...meaning that they do lots of small bites and detailed preparation for their food. Ajito is a small business with what I would describe as "well-crafted dishes" and small bites--I wouldn't recommend coming here if you were on a budget and starving. Portion sizes here are small and definitely not your Americanized type of sushi place.   Speed of service and organization are the main points I need to highlight during our experience. Our small sake also took a while to be delivered at the start of our experience, and every plate we ordered came out after 5 minutes of waiting...not bad! I totally understand because the plates are created with care and detail from the chefs. However, after we had the chirashi salad and the mochi balls, we sat at our empty tables for a WHOLE 30 minutes until we finally asked a frantic server (there were 4 servers running around the small shop, but none of them would pause to tell us what was going on with our last two dishes!) what was up with our grilled squid?! We reminded him that we also ordered a ramen and kindly asked if he could check the status of our orders. He promptly brought over our grilled squid and told us that we never put in an order of ramen :\ that was a disappointment.  It seems like everybody else here has had great experiences with Ajito, but I'm not gonna sugarcoat my service-lacking dinner. I was pretty bummed that my parents were not satisfied with this place, and we all agreed we wouldn't come back here again. Ajito seems like a place for people who don't mind waiting around for their food, having lots of drinks/down time with other diners. But if you're in a rush, or are super hungry...you will definitely be forced to wait and probably wonder what's up with your orders. Pricing is on the higher side with our salad being $9 and small sake at $7, just as examples, but I will say that their quality of foods is pretty great. Too bad service that Saturday, and the flow of the experience was totally not okay.  

                You know it's a good sign when 90% of the customers are Japanese.   Very quaint and cozy. The waiting area is very awkward because it gets so crowded after the two seats are taken. It's difficult for people to walk through when there are even two people in the waiting area. There were three four tops open and three different parties waiting in the area so service was a little behind. I think this could have been avoided considering that we all had reservations.   Hot towels are a nice touch.   1. Beef tongue - soft, perfectly seasoned it's not what I expected tongue to taste like. Texturally it's like thinly sliced beef.  2. Japanese omelette - slightly sweet, light, reminds me of soufflé because of the consistency.  3. Salmon and avocado tartare - flavor explosion! A must order. Chips are thinly sliced and pair perfectly with the tartare sauce.   4. Tail (skewer)  - chicken tail. Not bad considering I have never had tail before. It's just a little fat and cartilage   5. Breast, wings, gizzards, thigh (skewers) - all boring. I got them salted  6. Liver and heart skewers - love it, especially the liver but I'm a big fan of liver. If you haven't already had it, I would recommend trying it here because it's just a small order and it's pretty smokey and sweet. The liver taste isn't very strong  7. Monk fish liver - pretty good but I've had better.   8. Skin (skewer) - oh hell yeah  

                Came by for dinner the other night and there was plenty of parking in their private lot. We were seated immediately upon arrival without reservation.  Salmon Tartare - Chips tasted homemade and fresh. - Salmon and avocado were both fresh. Soy sauce was unique!  Miso Cod - Flavorful and fresh. (Iroriya has a better charred taste!)  Fried Oysters - Medium sized oysters and delicately fried. Decent  Chicken Soup - Bland and tasteless...skip  Chicken Karaage - Very and flavorful. - Perfectly fried with side of lettuce, broccoli & mayo!  Ramen - Okay. Nothing spectacular  Salt Wings - Okay. Chicken was fresh but again, Iroriya has a better charred taste!  Green Tea Tiramisu - Decent but didn't taste super fresh.  Interior is pretty basic. Service is very good by the staff.  ~$33/person after tax and tip.  

                After a failed attempt to go to Gaku down the street, we decided to try out another place that I had bookmarked for quite some time.   Let me start off by saying the service here is really friendly and prompt! Kudos to our waiter. Now onto the food. They don't have a lot of skewer options on their menu. Now with that being said, everything we had here was pretty good. My favorite is the extra crispy chicken skin, miso black cod, and salmon tartare (a MUST GET). Yummmmms! The other items, I thought they were pretty good but nothing too special. The chicken hearts and the wings were a little dry for my taste.   Yelp checkins get 10% off their first bill on Tuesday or Wendesday!  

                This could be my most favorite Japanese restaurant, that is also run by Japanese, which is not very common, in the Bay Area.  Ordered: Salted chicken wings yakitori - juicy and not burned Spicy chicken wings yakitori - juicy, not burned but too spicy for me Salted chicken thigh yakitori - juicy and not burned Salted chicken breast - dry and not burned.  Its plum sauce was too sour for me, but the Orange creamy one was yummy Soboro rice - too dry and salty Chicken and egg porridge - yummy but too small Gindara something - delicious but way too small Kaki Fry (deep fried oysters) - only 4 medium to small sized oysters  Too bad, yakitori here wasn't served with the special sauce like Yakitoriya in LA.  I think it's a mixture of wasabi with mustard - very spicy but super delicious.  Servers were very friendly and spoke like a native .  However, hot tea was never refilled unless we asked for one.  1 star was deducted because the portion was kinda small here, but the price was decent.  Will be back for their fusion menu.  

                I was craving some good Japanese food so we decided to come back to Ajito.  We started with the skin and gizzard skewer. Gizzard was still good, but the skin was not too tasty. It was very crunchy and difficult to eat.  The sashimi salad had salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and mackarel with mixed greens and a delicious dressing.  The black cod was not too sweet. It tasted like it was steamed and not seared.    The salmon onigiri and chicken onigiri was next. The salmon onigiri was more traditional, wrapped in seaweed with a decent amount of salmon in the middle. The chicken onigiri had fried rice on on the outside and it was a bit too tough. I liked the salmon onigiri, but the chicen onigiri not so much.  The soboro don was excellent. Tastes even better than I remembered as it was less salty and more flavorful.   At this point we were quite full, but wanted to finish it off with a half size ramen. The broth was really good although I would consider it more chinese than traditional japanese ramen. The noodles were thin and the one piece of chashu was slightly tough.  I'm glad the food prices here have stayed the same and I would gladly come back here to eat more.  

                I personally really really like this little tucked away in a random ish alley Japanese restaurant!   Their skewers and plates are definitely on point. The two times I've been here, I've been absolutely delighted by all the food dishes!!! It is my favorite place for chicken skin for sure. I have never had chicken skin as tasteful and crispy as the one I have here. It literally just melts in your mouth as you crunch it. Aah. So good. My mouth is salivating at just the thought of it. Aah! Speaking of melting in your mouth.. THE MISO BLACK COD.. So good. It really really melts just like butter in your mouth. Oh man oh man. And I really like starting off the meal with their salmon tuna avocado tartare with their homemade potato chips! It is so flavor packed and a nice starter to the meal! Sooo goood.   The atmosphere is very Japanese! If you come a little before dinner time when the whole place isn't filled yet, it is really quiet. Like dead silent. I'd feel like everyone would look at me if I spoke a little louder than my library voice. But as soon as dinner kicks in, it gets louder! Service is nice! And you get hot towels in the beginning!!! Diggin this place.  

                A great yakitori and tapas place with a friendly, casual atmosphere.  I like that you can order family style or each person can get their own individual items. The prices for the chicken skewers seem to be around $3-4 on average, which doesn't seem like much but it can quickly add up.  It's a great place to go to catch up with friends, after work with co-workers, or if you're looking for a family friendly place.  

                This is the first Izakaya that I tried in South Bay. Ippuku in Berkeley is my favorite restaurant, so I am drawing from previous experiences here..  The skewers are great. I prefer the salt option for flavoring over the sauce, the sauce didn't impress me that much and was perhaps too heavy in some cases. Great beef tongue, great gizzard, and the udon and ramen were good orders too. The food came out very fast, which is a big plus when you're sitting in a restaurant where the smells are just wafting freely from the kitchen and other tables (being a grill and all).   I think the atmosphere could use some work, but the food is good. The Chicken Kara-age was juicy but reminded me of Quickly's popcorn chicken. The grilled squid was good too! I wish they used some better spices than the supermarket S&B spice.  

                5 star service. Super friendly awesome staff. Quick service.   3.5 star food. Not my favorite izakaya in the bay.  Highlight was the beef tongue. Almost everything perfectly cooked. Low point was food was rather bland and flavorless. Yakitori (salt ) light on salt and char flavors. Would only return for the great service.  

                Food was high quality and costumer service was EXCELLENT!! Would definitely go back!!  My boyfriend said that there ramen was good but lacking in content.  Over all food was delicious.  

                A decent Japanese place, that specializes more in tapas than sushi. We tried their rice bowls, their beef tongue, and their ramen. Nothing stands out in particular. Also it was kind of hard to get refills for water, which can always be a bummer, particularly if the cups they serve you are small.  

                I went here with my boyfriend after work to avoid the traffic going home.  We ordered the yakitori set and extra on the side.  We love the gizzard, tails, and SKIN! Also we ordered Japanese sausage and the black pork sausage.  I'm not a fan because they tasted like Costco hot links.  We also get the monk fish pate.  It was fresh and yummy.  Tasted a lot like goose pate.  Our favorite was their green tea tiramisu.  So simple but yet it hits the spot.    The bill came out to be 90 dollars for two.  We had couple rounds of yakitori and food.  My boyfriend also had a whole pitcher of Sapporo.  Not too bad.  Will definitely will come back again to try their other food!  

                Good food, small place. Had some yakitori, it was done very well, altho I cannot tell the difference between the regular chicken heart and the special chicken heart....their beef tongue was splendid as well as the service. It can however runs a little pricy.  

                HIGHLIGHTS: -  Saba (mackerel) pressed sushi -  "Special" heart yakitori  Food:  3.5 stars Decor/Ambiance:  2.5 stars  Everything here was solid yakitori fare, but not amazing. There were a few things they did pretty well though, such as the "special" hatsu (chicken heart) yakitori. We asked the waitress what made the "special" heart... special. She basically said it was smaller and juicier. And yes, there was a "regular" and a "special" one. A whole bunch of terrible thoughts went through my mind about how low-grade the "regular" parts must be. Then I started to think about just what exactly I was eating here, and I decided to stop thinking about it. Bad idea in a yakitori joint. "Special" heart it is! We ordered one with salt and one with the marinade sauce. Both were great.  I was also surprised to see Saba (mackerel) pressed sushi. I really like this Kyoto-style dish, and not a lot of places have it because not everyone likes it. I love this dish though, so it's something I would go back for. That's pretty much the only reason I would trek down to have dinner at this crowded hole-in-the-wall on Bollinger.  

                If I had to name the best restaurant I've been to since moving to the Bay Area, Ajito is definitely at the top of that list. I have visited a couple of times, and each time, my experience left me feeling like I've died and flew to grilled bird heaven. *Chirp, Chirp*  This place is quite surprising, being a small restaurant located in a subdued strip mall. Most tables were empty even for a weekend night. Their menu is simple and not as extensive or creative as other Yakitori places. Regardless, I think Ajito excels at their Yakitori!  Prepare to be adventurous when you step in because Ajito offers every edible part of the chicken:  *Chicken thigh - a must try! Juicy and flavorful. *Chicken breast - good, but I prefer their thigh. *Chicken heart *Chicken gizzard *Grilled whole squid - got this every single time, they are just so succulent!  *Potato octopus balls - get this if you love takoyaki! *Chicken skins - my favorite! pro tip: always ask for extra crispy.  *Black pork sausages - delicious! *Crispy chicken donburi - not a favorite; more so of the sauce they put on top of the chicken. I would stick to their yakitori items. *Chicken karaage - bland and nothing special. *Yaki onigiri - so yummy, definitely different than the yaki onigiri I've had from Dan or Tanto. These are perfectly crispy, sweet on the outside, and on the inside, stuffed full with delicious minced chicken - so. good.   All their Yakitori are grilled to perfection over charcoal heat (no burnt marks or burnt taste on the meat) then sprinkled with just the right amount of salt. To allow patrons to fully enjoy their edible works of art, each skewer is served one at a time.  Tips: *Stick to ordering only the Yakitori. *Their 10% yelp check in offer is valid for dinner on Tuesday and Wednesday only.  

                I came here yesterday for lunch with my epicurean sister and cousin. Ajito is good for me because I don't eat pork or sashimi, and their specialty is chicken anyway. So I started to yelp again three weeks ago after a year abroad in Japan, and I think Ajito is better than 90% of what I had there. The servers can speak both English and Japanese.  We had a great time at Ajito because the food was excellent and the service was gracious. I ordered the Mackerel set meal while my sister had the Lunch Special du jour, which was a chicken katsu with an eggplant curry. The chicken katsu was succulent, and nicely fried. My cousin got the best though. She Tori Karaage I think, and it was phenomenal. The skin was crispy, and the meet inside was marinated. I have not had better karaage anywhere else!  My mackerel was also so good, I almost ate the skin. All the set meals during lunch comes with miso soup, rice, and salad. The soup is translucent like water when the bowl is still, but becomes opaque when you mix it, like it should be! The rice, even though it's just white rice, was no ordinary grain. It had moisture and was pleasing on the palate. And then the salad was also good.  Our server was attentive and always gave us more green tea when we ran out. I would definitely come again, but for lunch only, which is between 11:30 am and 1:30 pm. My cousin commented on the painting of blimps on the wall, and how she wanted it. Even my epicurean sister liked it, hence the five stars.  

                Very good experience.  Food: good value for price.  I like how they serve the black cod in miso. Good portion for the price.  The rice balls could use a bit more filling, but still was very tasty.  Chicken soup slightly bland, but still quite delicious. Beef tongue was awesome.  Atmosphere: a bit crowded, but so is every other good japanese place in this area.  Service. Great.  

                Came here on a Friday night for a late dinner (8pm-ish) with the family. Place was full but no wait. There were a number of parties that arrived later throughout the night and they were all seated immediately as well. Decor is cozy. Staff is courteous but slow.  Onto the food! We ordered: - Salmon avocado tartare: saw the reviews and saw everyone getting this. Yes it's so delicious! 5/5  - daikon Mochi agedashi: fried Mochi balls in dashi broth. Mochi was softer and less chewy than expected. Decent but wouldn't recommend. 3.5/5  - Ike kara (fried squid): this is a whole squid but presented like calamari where it's just a jumbled pile of squid. Really delicious, love the batter. 5/5  - Momo (?) chicken steak: chicken thigh in this amazing garlic butter teriyaki sauce. It was so good! 5/5  - Lettuce cups: the minced chicken and filling was substantial and nice quality but the sauce was missing a certain zing factor to it. 4/5  - Yaki udon: stir fried udon, while al dente, was super bland and overall boring. 1/5  - Ramen: again not amazing, their noodles are relatively hard and there's not much in terms of toppings. 2.5/5  Overall would probably come back to try more items!  

                Denied entry for dinner at Tanto by 45 minute wait, we try our luck at Ajito instead. What? No wait here! Getting there, there's a small lot that was pretty full but we get our spot. Inside, it's pretty straight forward in terms of decor. Not all fancy with wood panels like Gocchi and such but functional nonetheless.   The menu here is mostly starters and appetizers plus a selection of noodle and rice dishes. This is food for drinking but not exactly izakaya.   Grilled cod with miso (on their specials board) - Umami taste of sweet, salty all in one. Cod is nice and tender with slight smokiness from the grilling. Best of the night.  Daikon mochi agadashi - little fat discs of delight. Crisp on the outside from deep frying with daikon and mild chewiness of mochi inside. Dipped in soy sauce for saltiness.   Ground pork stir fried with lotus root and served with lettuce. Mediocre dish. Don't kill me if I say the version at PF Chang's is better. Yes, sad but true.  Cheese risotto - This is unique in that the risotto is mixed in a huge block of cheese in front of you then served. Bits of bacon and lots of cheesiness. Taste like a carbonara but with rice. Still, second best dish of the night.  Service was generally prompt but you have to flag down the wait staff as they mostly fly by. Lots of Japanese people in there so that's your measure of goodness. Another plus is they offer a small selection of gluten free items on the menu (kids too).  

                When we entered, the whole place smelled smoky, which was due to Japanese BBQ / Yakiniku and no ventilation was used.  That was the bad sign of a restaurant and failing to meet the Japanese standard. Service was really slow and we waited 20+ mins for yakiniku and once we got it, the food were warm to cold!!    The only positive side is kids menu was good, and the plate came with Hello Kitty plate.  

                I had high expectations for Ajito, but the food was just okay. We started with the salmon tartare which was good, although the potato chips were a weird/unnecessary garnish. Karage was crisp and juicy - probably the best dish of the night. From there we ordered a bunch of chicken skewers, including thigh, heart, gizzard, cartilage. The textures were different, but I started to feel like I was just eating the same thing over and over. You can opt for your skewer to be salted or glazed in sauce, and I couldn't really tell the difference when we ordered both.   We also ordered the whole grilled squid and the hamachi kama, both of which I enjoyed much more than the chicken.  

                We love this place because the food is yummy and the service is pretty good. The ramen and dons are decent and the kebabs are amazing. I also like how they have the 10% off with yelp check in. This place is slightly pricey, but on par with other Japanese places. I'd highly recommend this place.  

                "Izakaya for the chicken lover" that would be my slogan for them, since they only have one beef skewer and that being beef tongue.  We ordered so many things i'll just list and rate.  Beef tongue - 5 stars - very good and juicy  Chicken thigh - 3 stars - good, but again no charcoal flavor Crispy chicken skin w/ ponzu special appetizer - 3 stars - fried skin Takowasa - 4.5 stars - first time having this, was awesome. Okra skewers - 2 stars - okra was very slimy, maybe suppose to be like that? Shishito peppers, sauced - 3 stars - lacked any sauce flavor Mochi balls -  4.5 stars - served in tsuyu soup base, tasty  Sake sashimi - 4 stars - very fresh, good sized slices.  We also ordered a large hot sake of which had a super long name that I couldn't pronounce.  It was $20 for a large, but the large is really small like around 300ml.  To give our server credit, she was able to pronounce the 14 character name of our sake with ease.   We received excellent service here, and overall it was a good experience.  Oh damn you get a hot towel when you are sat like back in the day, i love those towels such a nice touch.  

                If you eat chicken, this is the place you might want to check out.  The food here is decent but somewhat overpriced in my opinion, there are a few entrees on the menu that seemed like it was sloppily put together. But overall the service is great and the grilled meats were delicious. I particularly liked the Chicken skin and chicken gizzards.  

                Nothing here really blew me away. Everything was okay, but not great. The yakitori was a little over-done, missing that good charcoal smoke flavor, and comes out a bit room-temperature. Other dishes are okay, but it can't compete against some of the other better izakayas throughout the Silicon Valley. Their service was wonderful, though!  

                Ajito is on the other side of Bollinger across from Home Depot.  It's a small place tucked in a non-descript strip mall.  This place appears to be a favorite with the Japanese.  Our visit was on Valentine's Day, so it may have been especially crowded.  Nonetheless, I would recommend reservations or coming at opening time.  We went at opening.  The place was full within 30 minutes.  Ajito leans more towards yakitori and grilled tapas.  They don't really have sushi rolls.  The salmon tartar with avocado and homemade potato chips was a nice effort.  The contrasting texture of the crunchy chips and the smooth avocado and sashimi is a treat.  Unfortunately, the potato chips were too salty and the sauce was a little too sweet.  Both overwhelm the salmon.  Try using something lighter and unsalted, like a tortilla chip.  The seaweed salad was very good, light and refreshing.  The chicken yakitori thigh was tender and juicy.  It was definitely the best part of the meal.  The pork belly with daikon was dry and lacking in flavor.  For a meat that is essentially pure fat, this was a surprising disappointment.  It could use a sauce to liven up the flavor.  The yaki onigiri was decent, though just a tad too cripsy.  I think it only comes stuffed with salmon.  It would be nice to offer the same choices as the non-fried onigiri: salmon, plum, bonito flakes, or spicy cod roe.  The yaki udon was very tasty with lots of vegetables.  Finally, the grilled, whole squid was not very good.  It was served plain with just a tiny dollop of Kewpie mayonnaise, plus some other condiment.  It was dry and bland.  I would not recommend this dish.  All in all, it was not a great experience but not bad either.  There are still plenty of other dishes to try, so we may give it another shot.  

                The boy and I went here last week for dinner. Silly me, I thought we could get by without a reservation, but he insisted we call. It was Saturday and I called around 6:30 to make a reservation for 7:30. Luckily I did call because they were quite busy and suggested that we make a reservation for 8. It was good because when I got there, their dinner rush was just leaving and opening a spot for us.  I wouldn't know what authentic Japanese food is, but from the boy's account who just spent three weeks there, Ajito is a pretty good restaurant that resembles that authenticity. We were served with warm towels to wipe our hands (and face, if you choose to) and from what I was told, is what they also do in Japanese restaurants. The menu had quite a selection from rice dishes to sushi (none of those "fancy" rolls, the legit stuff) to noodles to yakitori. The boy and I really liked yakitori, so the ordered a few skewers and tried some interesting ones like the chicken heart (not the special heart, but regular heart) and the beef tongue (not yakitori style). We also ordered the chicken karaage and the moriwase. I was really, really interested in the risotto when I saw another table being served from a giant cheese block, but I resisted as I knew we had enough food.  Everything was really tasty. I loved the sashimi and the skewers. The chicken hearts were an interesting taste - a little chewy, but I hear that it's supposed to be since it's a muscle. The beef tongue was also good, but I had my own personal qualms about eating tongue. It just feels weird to have tongue on my tongue! The boy said the karaage was better than Orenchi's karaage, so that's a plus. The chicken skin was also pretty good too.  The experience was quite nice up until the end when I wanted some dessert. For some reason or other, they were out of the green tea parfait AND the green tea tiramisu! The only two desserts I wanted to try! Ugh! We settled for ice cream instead and while it was tasty, it still wasn't a parfait. Oh well. Maybe next time?  Our server was also pretty good - at least in the beginning. He was willing to help out and answer any of our questions. He was really attentive and made sure we got everything and didn't have concerns. After all our food came out... he kind of disappeared. I had to rely on other servers to help with the refilling of my tea, dessert, and the bill. I don't know if it was standard practice to share all tables among servers, but it felt as if he was tending to us until he wasn't.  I definitely think we'll be back someday to eat here. It's yummy! (Can't remember if it was affordable because I didn't look at the check. lol oops!)  

                I tried the fried oysters from the lunch menu: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajito-cupertino?select=fCvapciqF877gHee8aRhdg#fCvapciqF877gHee8aRhdg">yelp.com/biz_photos/ajit…</a>  Several problems: - I don't recommend the fried oysters.  It's probably traditional Japanese style, but it's not as good as New Orleans style fried oysters. - The sticky rice was overcooked and mushy. - They don't offer any yakitori items during lunch: that stuff is only available at dinner.  I also tried the green tea tiramisu: <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ajito-cupertino?select=fCvapciqF877gHee8aRhdg#f0X5TiYaghExqQW_mPA1Jw">yelp.com/biz_photos/ajit…</a> Terrible: it had almost no green tea flavor, and there was no contrast between the whipped cream on top and the cake layer on the bottom.  Japanese pastries are known to be "less sweet", but this was nearly flavorless.  A total waste of $5.50  Basically, the most disappointing meal I've had in recent memory.  

                we rent for a late dinner at around 8:45pm. Not too bad for yakitori, except they should twist the menu a little bit, not of the items aren't too clear in terms of quantities...we almost ordered 8 pieces of sausages as one order got 4 pieces.....the minced chicken pouched egg don was something I thought they can twist a little by putting salmon roe on it.   I was expecting more favorite on their chef's special chicken skin dish...but we both thought the yakitori was better compared to the dish.   Anyway, not a bad experience afterall.  

                Came in here for dinner. Wasn't very impressed given the high ratings here. The yakitori was under-seasoned, too dry, and too highly priced for this quality. Happy too see a yakitori place open up in the area, but hope they can improve the yakitori.  

                Wow, where do I begin.  So I found Ajito on Yelp after learning that one of my favourite Japanese restaurants, "Dan" on Saratoga was fully booked up on a Sunday evening.  After reading the reviews here, I went to Ajito with high expectations but was sorely let down in the most unexpected of ways.  To be clear - the food was really good.  Not exceptional, but definitely well above average.  How Ajito racked up several negative stars from me comes from their disorganized front of house and lack of empathy for good client service from several of their staff.  The best way to describe my poor experience is to retell it chronologically.  After my party of 4 sat down, we waited 10 minutes before anybody came, and they had 4 servers working that night with about 50% of the restaurant full when we arrived.  More people started coming, and we clearly saw 2 parties seated AFTER us and get drink orders and hot towels served to them BEFORE us.  I attempted to flag down 2 servers on 2 separate occasions but was ignored.  I finally flagged down a server (let's call her GLASSES GIRL because she wore glasses and wore a black shirt) who was extremely apologetic and well intentioned.  Let me be clear - GLASSES GIRL was fantastic, and I hope she finds a job elsewhere because her talents are being wasted at Ajito.  GLASSES GIRL took our order, and I asked about hamachi sashimi.  I learned that they don't have hamachi sashimi, but only grilled yellowtail cheek (this becomes important later).  I told GLASSES GIRL that I'm not interested in cooked hamachi, so she took the rest of our order.  After a few dishes were delivered to our table, a different server (let's call her PONYTAIL) with a red shirt served us a dish of grilled hamachi cheek.  I told her that I didn't order it, and PONYTAIL was definitely confused.  I asked PONYTAIL what to do - either take it back, or let me have it for free; and this stumped her so she ran to the back of the restaurant to talk to BOSS LADY (she looked in charge with a black shirt).  Meanwhile, the hamachi cheek is sitting on our table and we aren't touching it because we didn't order it.  GLASSES GIRL comes by to check on us and I tell her about the mistaken order, and she apologizes profusely and says we can have it for free.  Great, she's making up for our bad experience already!  I love GLASSES GIRL!  :)  About 10 minutes later, BOSS LADY who ignored me from the beginning comes to our table and asks us about the hamachi.  I told her we didn't order it, and I could see in the background that PONYTAIL had gone to BOSS LADY for advice after telling us that we could eat the hamachi on the house and she was worried about getting in trouble.  BOSS LADY asked us "have you touched the hamachi" and after we said "no", she took it back to serve to another table.  WTF!!!  Don't take my word for it.  The hamachi was sitting there for 10-15 mins before she took it back after being served, asking us if we touched it isn't good enough to re-serve it to someone else!!!  That's TERRIBLE.  Gordon Ramsay would have a fit.  In addition to all these F-ups, BOSS LADY meanwhile has been entertaining a table of friends and completely ignoring all the ineptitude and mistakes in the dining room with other diners.  Pouring glass after glass of wine for her friends, right when we were about to leave we heard a huge *shriek* scream coming from her table.  Looks like BOSS LADY is less into the business of serving customers a great experience, and more about having fun with her friends and ignoring her staff.  I won't be going back.  I paid my bill, but kept the tip aside separately for GLASSES GIRL.  I apologized to GLASSES GIRL for not leaving an overall tip, but gave her one specifically because she did a good job and my poor experience wasn't her fault.  GLASSES GIRL - if you read this, and I hope you do; good luck in your restaurant career, don't let BOSS LADY and this crappy front of house experience ruin your future.  :D  TLDR; go to "Dan" on Saratoga instead.  Better food, better service.  

                This place is a mash up of a Izakaya and a yakitori place with a good selection of sashimi. It took over the space of where Red Crane used to be. I love that they start off by giving you warm hand towels :)  We ordered the salmon tartare, agedashi mochi, and moriawase (15 pieces of sashimi). All three were excellent and I would highly recommend them. Prices were reasonable too.  The other reviews rave about their cartilage and gizzard, but my fellow diner and I realized that neither yakitori's were our cup of tea, so unfortunately I can't put in my two cents.  

                Food is pretty good and tasty. Loses stars for poor service. Server took order and only came back to table with the check. Owner missing revenue by not training staff to revisit tables to see if customers want anything else. Amazing; literally dropped the check without a word. We wanted water and I had to get up and hunt down the wait staff. She brought us water, went back behind a screen and did not ask another table if they wanted anything. Format; take order, drop food, drop check.  

                MMM.. This place was a pleasant surprise. After having a heavy lunch the bf and I were looking for something light for dinner so we decided skewers would be a great choice. I had Ajito booked mark for a while so I was happy to cross it off my bucket list.  The skewer selection is not as big as other yakitori restaurants I've been too but the quality of food and service makes this place stand out. The only con I had about this place is the music they play. It's like some sort of children lullabies which was smoothing but did not go well with the ambience. Now about the food....    Chicken wrap: Minced chicken breast with mushrooms, peanuts and water chestnuts. It was bland and need some sort of sauce but the dish overall was good.  Grilled Onigiri (chicken): I love onigiri! And I love it even more when its grilled. I didn't care much for the chicken filling in this onigir but overall it was still very tasty.  Garlic seaweed fries: I now what you are thinking? Why order fries when I should be ordering something more exotic. Well, I was craving fries and these totally hit the spot. There was a nice balance of garlic that wasn't too overpowering.  Beef tongue: Chewy but divine. We squeezed the lemon and sprinkled the chili powder on it which made the dish taste even better.  Spicy chicken wings (Sauce): Spicy and saucy. Tasty.  Chicken wings (Sauce): Meh. I like the spicy chicken wings better since it had more flavor.  Chicken hearts (Sauce): MMMMMMM. These were also scrumptious. It was very well marinated and had a slight chewy texture.  Chicken Breast (Salt): I don't care much for white meat so I didn't try this skewer but from the looks of it, it seemed really dry.  Chicken skin (Salt): MMMMMM! I wished we had ordered more of this. It was lightly salted, crispy and just delicious. Definitely, a must order skewer!  Shiitake Mushrooms (Sauce): It was ok, nothing really special about it.  Okra: Grilled okra topped with bonito flakes. I didn't try it but my bf seem to like it.  Overall, this place deserves 5 stars. I would definitely come back and try the other dishes.  

                This place was so cozy as comfortable. The customer service was superb and so was the food. I loved the sashimi meal for lunch hour; definitely affordable and the quality was very good.  

                A great place to enjoy food with great company! You can order a lot of small plates and surprisingly, it won't do too much damage to your wallet!  Personally, I liked the entrees and side dishes better than the grilled meats. It's been awhile since I've had yakitori since I had a scarring moment with food poisoning from under cooked meat, which consequently resulted in a a $100 bill from the doctor and a lovely bottle of antibiotics about two years ago. So, I was a bit nervous coming here. But here I am, writing this review, healthy and alive!  The things we ordered:  - Sashimi salad: Yummy! A healthier alternative than nigiris. The dressing was delicious, too... not sure if it's housemade but it tastes like the one you can get at Mitsuwa. The fish were fresh and offered in a good variety, too. The end got a bit too salty for me since the bottom was drenched with dressing.  - Risotto: Okay... we ended up getting this for the experience because it's literally rice stirred up in a huuuuge block of parmesan cheese. I wasn't a fan of it...   - Dom buri: So yummy!!! i could eat this forever.  - Yakitori: I really liked the spicy wings. It's pretty ginger-y. I don't recommend the chicken breast though since it was pretty bland.. I recommend the meats with sauce over the salted versions. Honestly, I wasn't very adventurous and stuck with the normal meats. No heart/liver for me...  -Salmon spring rolls: Eh... it was ok. I felt like the mint inside totally overpowered everything so all I tasted was mint. Too bad!  If you're a meat/yakitori lover, I'd go to Sumiya instead. But if you love Japanese food with a twist, I'd come here! This is a great place to impress visitors visiting the area, too!  Ajito had really awesome service, too. The servers there were on their feet and super friendly and helpful.  You also get to enjoy your meal with super poppy Disney songs playing the background if you listen carefully ;)  

                The food quality is generally pretty good here. The Daikon Salad is very flavorful and refreshing. Rissoto is creamy and rich. The squid bits Tako Potato Ball are bouncy and chewy. However the ginger flavor is a little overwhelming over the potato ball. I would give 4 stars if the food is not as salty.  

                Just my quick review of their chicken skin: It is the best I ever had in the bay area.
