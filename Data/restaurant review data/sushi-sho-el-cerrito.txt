                My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place since its right down the street and we love sushi. But we were in for a surprise. We got there at around 6:30 pm and there was about 6 people in there and we were told they were filled. They said we would have to wait an hour!! The restaurant was empty but we had to wait an hour, thats unbelievable. We left after that.  I don't think I can give this spot another chance.
