                The hot summer days in Vallejo have brought me glory, as I find myself at La Michoacana having to decide which of the delicious, home-made ice-cream or popsicle (paleta) flavors I will get...the fresh-fruit flavor, huge chunks of fruit, and taste of being made at home...make it so difficult to choose, I just end up taking 4 or 5 paletas or a few scoops home to eat and share with my husband as refreshing healthy deserts!  The place is roomy and has friendly staff, which is welcoming to sit down, relax, and chow with friends or family when you have time to spare.  Also, since I love having people over and making parties, I just found out today that when you buy 18+ paletas, you get a portable cooler free...and if you're making a BIG party....they let you borrow an ice-cream cart for FREE! Perfect for birthday parties!  ....I can't get over the idea of having our own ice-cream cart at one of our niece's birthday parties.... :)
