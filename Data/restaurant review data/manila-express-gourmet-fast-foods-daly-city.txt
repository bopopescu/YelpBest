                I have been coming here since the '90's and I just love coming back here.  Ateh Dita (owner) is very nice.  She makes it very homey for me and my family.  I love her bbq's, pansit and lumpia.  Everything about this place is just wonderful.    I highly recommend anyone to come here especially if you want to eat some Filipino foods.  The price is reasonable and you won't regret it for trying it here.  Thank you Ateh Dita for great service and hoping you'll be around for a very long time.
