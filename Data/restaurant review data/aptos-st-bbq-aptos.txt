                I would give this amazing BBQ place 5 stars if the sides were better...the meat is all great top notch! BUT the sides are not good at all the beans have a strange taste to much chile P? I don't know, the slaw and potato salad are horrible and bland and you don't have any other sides besides that!? Oh extra garlic bread...you need to roast some corn on those grills, have sweet potato fries and macaroni and cheese/corn bread/greens you need a suggestion box the owner I here is a asshole and won't change a thing other then the sides I love Aptos st BBQ! I get my meat from Aptos then go to SIDS BBQ for my sides down the road...beer is kinda pricy as we'll the sour beers 5 OZ for $6 is crazy expensive just charge $8 for a pint PS turn the music down too it's hard to talk to friends when we are their.
