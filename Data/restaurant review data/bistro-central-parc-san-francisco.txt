                The croque madame (melted swiss, ham, bechamel on pain de mie, sunny side up egg) was quite good. It was in the shape of a sandwich, but it really had to be eaten with a fork and a knife. This was quite a unique dish and I loved how the swiss cheese was melted on top of the toast.  I also tried my girlfriend's omelette with ham and grilled onions. It was a bit runny from the onions, but I thought it was really well made.   After we paid the bill, our group just sat around and caught up with each other. They didn't kick us out since it didn't seem too busy, so that was a plus.
