                We are new to the area and decided to go explore the downtown Clayton area. First of all, such a charming, hometown feel...lovely! We walked the town and looked at all of the different little restaurants and decided on Ed's Mudville Grill and we were so happy that we did!   There is a nice big patio outside, if the weather is nice and it is NON SMOKING! I love that since I have young children. When you walk through the door, you are greeted by some great sports memorabilia. It is a down home, comfortable feeling overall. Kind of like "Cheers"...if you went there often, everyone would know your name kinda thing.   We had 3 hungry children with us so, the server was very efficient and made sure to get to us quickly. That was appreciated!   The food was GREAT ( the carnitas was AMAZING!) and priced fairly and there was an extensive beer selection which made the hubby very happy. Â Although, it is pretty pricey (the beer!) which is why I took off one star.   We will definitely be back...again and again!
