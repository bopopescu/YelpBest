                Once again this place did not fall short of anything    Service was spectacular. I couldn't believe how attentive the waiters were without being intrusive.   We started with the pei mussels which had A creamy tomato base. 7/10  Caesar salad split in two plates. A heavy amount of cheese which made it satisfying.   I enjoyed the dry rubbed New York steak and fries. They perfectly cooked it medium rare and it was so tender it almost tasted like ribeye.  The arugula was very flavorful with a tangy dressing and the fries were not greasy and very crispy.   The girlfriend enjoyed the FILO wrapped chicken. Although we weren't expecting a crumble type of fried skin.   The only complaint I have would be the bread that is served. It has a tendency to taste about 2 days old with a very chewy crust.   Will definitely be coming back!!
