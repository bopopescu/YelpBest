                This is the cutest sandwich spot in Vallejo! They are new & busy...which is great! I checked their reviews on yelp prior to coming & was prepared to wait a little. Not much of a wait at all...amazing service & really good food! I have a very demanding husband, 2 teenaged boys & two smaller ones...all pretty difficult to satisfy!! They were all pleased & full which makes me HAPPY! Give them a chance & keep in mind that they are new & a family owned business...just some average joes like the rest of us...not togos, subway....way more personal with a real family touch!! We will be regulars...that's for sure!!
