                What a great dining experience! I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and he loved it, says it's one of the best gifts he's ever gotten. :D  I wouldn't say it's the fanciest of restaurants, which is a good thing. It's not the kind of place people go to put on a show and be flashy. It's laid back but still classy and elegant  I called ahead to reserve a table and told them it was for a birthday. I also asked to preorder a bottle of champagne. When we arrived we were seated at a great cozy candle-lit booth overlooking the rest of the restaurant. They promptly brought us waters and our champagne and made us feel right at home.  Everything we ate was incredible, especially the bone marrow! They were even sweet enough to bring out a complimentary dessert for the birthday celebration. I actually regretted preordering the champagne cause they have a good looking cocktail menu, so if you go, have a drink on my behalf!
