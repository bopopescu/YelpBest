                This is such a cool kick it spot. They have ALOT of beer selections. I came here on a Thursday night looking for a place to just chill. We got rejected at this other beer bar on embarcadero so we found this place on yelp!   We came in, bartender was friendly, he engaged in a conversation and gave us suggestions on beer. We went to the back patio where it was very peaceful and for some reason, it reminded me of the tv show Friends with the brick walls and outdoor patio. Lol. Everyone was minding their own business and it was just a drama free zone! I loved it! But i minus a star cause one of the Â cups had lipstick mark on it before we even drank it. :X
