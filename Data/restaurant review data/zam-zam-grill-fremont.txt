                Great food! I had the combination plate to go, and it was great! The meat is tender, and the spices are delicious! I asked for mine extra spicy, and it was still mild for me. The tzatziki sauce is wonderful, and the hummus is tasty. I highly recommend this place for lunch. It would have 5 stars if they accepted debit cards (as cash only places are not my favorite) and had a quicker turnaround on the food ordering (since the wait after ordering is about 20 minutes).
