                Came here with the wife, mother in law, brother and a friend on Sat night Jan 31st 2015.  Called too late to make a reservation (I would NOT suggest doing this as Sotto Mare is super popular), but totally lucked out as a big group cancelled and we got seated outside.    Food was AWESOME. Get everything, as it's all great.  Knock yourself out.
