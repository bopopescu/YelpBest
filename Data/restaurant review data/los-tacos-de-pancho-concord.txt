                I have been coming here for about 7 years! A local gem that's close to home and family owned! You can't beat that!   Tons of options on the menu board as you walk in. A few tables and a small t.v. to watch the game if you want. The area isn't the nicest but well lit and seems to be a stop well liked by concord police. I always see them in there eating.  The staff is super nice, fast, and friendly. Large portions, good spices, and prices!  I've got everything from enchiladas, tacos, burritos here, and everything has always been great and I usually can't finished what I get. Also great salsas and fries. I haven't had a bad experience here yet and better that a lot of more expensive places in the area. Not a high end place, but that not why you would go here. You go for great food and even better prices.
