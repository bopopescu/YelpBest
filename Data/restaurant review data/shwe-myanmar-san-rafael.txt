                I ordered a vegetarian Samusa Soup to go the first time I tried this place. The serving was generous and delicious. The second time I ordered this dish to go it was much smaller. My partner ordered spicy/crispy chicken; he said it was soft and sour and that he did not enjoy it.   After seeing how much smaller the portions became in a such a short amount of time, we probably will not be going back.
