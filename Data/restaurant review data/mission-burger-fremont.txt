                I just ate here today. It's my second time eating here. I ate here like 5 years ago. My fiance was hungry for a burger so I met up with him. Anyways! I had a cheeseburger and it was pretty good. It hit the right spot cause I was hungry. He had the teriyaki burger and it seemed like he enjoyed it. We also shared large fries. They looked huge and they were nicely cooked and crispy. The vanilla shake was good also, just a typical shake. You order outside from their stand and they have a bunch of outdoor picnic tables. There's some pretty good shade also around so you don't have the sun hitting you. Service is friendly and fast enough. Parking is tight.
