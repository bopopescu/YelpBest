                Maybe my personal experience of koubideh is limited (I've only had it here) but I was definitely pleased with the food. Tasty flavors and that charred tomato is super good.  The employees (and maybe an owner, I can't be sure) are supremely friendly and really care about your experience.   Also isn't koubideh just fun to say?
