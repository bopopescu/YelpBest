                For a sushi place that has a modern flare and is open up pretty late, it's pretty awesome!   My boyfriend and I love sushi an are always excited to try new places out. So when we found out that there was a sushi place about 15/20 minutes from us that's open passed 9:00... We were all about it! Our schedules suck, leaving late night time the only one time to have dinner, so we were eager to try this place!   The parking lot is private, but there's more room behind the building if it packed.   Once you walk in, there's a full bar, an eager staff, and modern decor.   The food: the karaage is pretty god, as are the baked Â green mussels.. A just have for my boyfriend I when we go.   The rolls are perfectly sized, not too much, not too little, and have a fresh and CLEAN taste to it. Nothing is more appealing to me than a clean cut presentation on a plate and thus place has it down.   It's definitely worth a try! :)
