                I'm a burger junkie. I pretty much would travel just about anywhere to find a really good burger. With that said, I traveled to the wonderful world of San Mateo!  Jacks Prime was my choice of destination for a burger. The interior of the restaurant is really nice. It has a really nice Diner feel about it. The staff is friendly, and were polite and helpful. For the burger. I ordered the big jack. A double patty cheeseburger. I always have my burgers medium rare. Mmm juicy! Well my burger was more on the medium side than medium rare. But still very juicy! The burger patties tasted very good. A juicy beef patty makes a happy me.  The bun was pretty dry. It wasn't moist and fluffy. When you bite into the burger you taste a lot of bread. It was ok though. The fries, were ok. Tasted like frozen fries. Not the best. Five guy burger fries hands down way better! Mmmm . Jacks fries don't make me wanting more lets put it that way.. The shakes are pretty good. I had a black n white shake which was delish.  Would I come back to jacks? Yes I would. The burgers are good, and the food is not bad. I like the place.
