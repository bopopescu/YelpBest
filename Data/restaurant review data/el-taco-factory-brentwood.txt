                Quality, Consistency, and Betty, are the main ingredients making the El Taco Factory the best place for a taco in the Brentwood area.  A simple menu varied by an extensive selection of meats to choose from, makes this place tops on our list for good food. The pinto beans are freshly cooked till tender and served whole inside both the tacos and burritos for a unique improvement on the more redundant traditional standard.  Some people might be alarmed at first having to pay 4 bucks for a taco; but be assured it is quickly dismissed once you receive your food. Â If your appetite compels you to desire larger portions, then the Super Burrito will more than satisfy your manly hunger. The restaurant is diminutive in size so tables can be at a premium during the rush hour; but generally made available by the time your food is prepared and served.
