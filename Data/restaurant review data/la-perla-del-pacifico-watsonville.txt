                First.... i have no idea what is going on with all these people who give this place a high rating. IT SUCKS.   I would rather have had taco bell, and i HATE taco bell.  the fish was not sweet and fresh as it should be. I had a "grilled" fish taco which tasted like it was cooked on a dirty flat top and had no flavor other than whatever dish was cooked right before it.   The beans, rice and french fries were greasy and flavorless other than the oil that was used to cook them in..  bottom line... this place gets one star for the great beer and customer service.
