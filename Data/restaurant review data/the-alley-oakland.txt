                Not a fan.   Came here for a friend's party. It's really not an ideal place for a large group, max 4. We had like 12 in our party, so we couldn't sit together. It was dark, the bar was crowded, there was a wait to sing at the piano bar. The people who do sing are clearly regulars who hog the piano. The old man who plays is hard to hear/understand. I ended up butchering "Dream a little Dream," because the dude just began playing, no discussion of key or tempo. I did choir for 7 years, I know how to fucking sing with a pianist accompanying me. I got so flustered that I didn't want to finish. I had two crappy beers and left. On the plus side, I did have a nice convo with the bartender, she was hilarious and sweet.
