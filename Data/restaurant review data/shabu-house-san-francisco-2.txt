                #Wait time# Got there on a Saturday evening around 6, so there was no wait then. But I did notice that the line started to form around 6:30, so be sure to make reservations or get there early enough to skip the line.  #Menu# The soup options are water, ginger chicken and spicy miso. They also have half-and-half pots, so it is very popular to get half ginger chicken and half spicy miso. The spicy miso can get a bit spicy if cook veggies in it, but if it is just used on meat, it taste pretty mild. All combinations include veggies, noodles, tofu and one or two kinds of meat which is pork, beef or lamb. Two portions are available, standard or large. The standard is slightly larger than Shabuway's, since the price is a little higher. They also have an all you can eat option, in case you have a big appetite. Dessert is complimentary. They have green tea and red bean flavored ice cream.  #Tips# 15% off if order during happy hour which is 5-6pm everyday.
