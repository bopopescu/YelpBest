                Came here right before the Warriors game on Tuesday. No wait, which was perfect since I had read reviews that said it gets packed.   For 4 of us, we tried 3 different types of Mac and cheese. We tried the Mexican with breadcrumbs.. The gilroy garlic with mushrooms, bacon, and breadcrumbs. And lastly, the gilroy garlic with bacon, spinach, and chicken. The last of the 3 was the most amazing! The other 2 were good, but my selection was outstanding! The portions are huge so we packed a good amount to bring home.   I can't wait to be back! I'm gonna attempt to recreate it at home but I'm sure it won't happen.
