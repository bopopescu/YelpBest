                I love Rose Garden, i have been coming here for about 12 years. The food has never changed, the owners are awesome people who are super friendly! Its not the fanciest place on the inside but the food is delicious! i really enjoy the salt and pepper chicken, pot stickers, and the kung pao. All in all i highly recommend rose garden its an excellent place to eat.
