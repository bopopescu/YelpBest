                Tried the crispy portobellos! Very good! Prefer the ranch over red pepper tho. The girl that helped me was De Ana. She let me sample the soup. Gave me suggestions. Gave me options and just was all around incredible! Absolutely the best service I've ever had in Marin. Give the girl a raise!
