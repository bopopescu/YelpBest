                Went here for a change of pace last weekend. We didn't read the opening hours so arrived at 4 when the dinner doesn't start till 5 but no biggie, got some drinks and hung out. The food is good, not great (i had the veal which was OK but nothing special) the lobster my girlfriend had was pretty good and the steaks the kids had were so so. Having said that its cute little dive bar with the hats on the ceiling, foods pretty good and the service is very good. I would go there again if I happened to be in the neighborhood but wouldn't go there specially for the food. Oh and forget the water it has a very distinct sulfur taste. Sort of like drinking quarry water unfiltered straight from the tap. get the bottled water. Overall good but nothing spectacular.
