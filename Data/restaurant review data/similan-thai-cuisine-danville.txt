                Loved this place!  Who doesn't love Thai food?  My friend Robert and I had dinner here.  His mother had eaten here and said it was great.  We shared the Pad Thai(I always have to get it) and the Green Chicken Curry with brown rice.  OMG!  Everything tasted amazing.  It's a cute little place and the service was wonderful.  Each table had the most beautiful, colorful flowers(real).  I had a glass of Cakebread chardonnay(pricey) but my hot guy insisted that I get it, and of course I loved it.  Thai food and Cakebread chardonnay!  Life is good!
