                While on the road for sales calls I had seen the sign for this place as large as the sun! After I was finished working i stopped in to order some lunch, I was not disappointed. It reminds me of the old A&W Root beer joints I had eaten at when I was a kid.  So inside i went, first thing the place is clean, well kept and organized.   The menu was extensive with all the items you would see in a good burger joint and then some. Ordered the standard burger with fires! with all the fix-ins. Grabbed a soda and sat at one of the small tables. When I waited the place filled up with all the local 99% ers that have jobs in the area. My order # was called and it looked good, fresh tomatoes, red onions and lettuce with pickles I was impressed. My food was real tasty and made like I want it well done.  Its was a Giant Burger for sure!   facility's - the bathrooms were clean this is a plus! and looked safe....  I would say when in town check them out!
