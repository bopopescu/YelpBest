                The sashimi here is so fresh!  And there are three pages of special rolls to choose from (complete with mouth watering pictures that make you want to just order everything!) so you don't have the dilemma of cook vs fried or even vegetarian options!  We ordered the Sea steak appetizer, Instagram Roll, and Genzoe Neo Traditional roll. Yum :9  The tuna appetizer was an eye opener for sure! If you're a sashimi snob, the quality of the cut and tenderness of the fish won't disappoint.   Also topped our meal off with a slice of the Guava cake to share. There was definitely enough for two!  Will be back to try more rolls. But will try to avoid busy weekend nights and hour waits the next time (came in @7, seated at 8:10pm)  

                Wow! Me and boyfriend went here for the first time on a Saturday night and we were so IMPRESSED by everything about this place. The ambiance is perfect-- perfect for families, date night, and hanging out with friends. It has a modern feel which I like about sushi joints.  The service here is fantastic! The waitresses are really knowledgable and give good recommendations on what to get.   Free appetizer with check in! (:  The sushi is so fresh! The most fresh I've tasted compared to other Bay Area sushi places.   Will definitely be back for happy hour times  

                Rainbow Roll (4 Stars) - Very Fresh Fish and standard Rainbow Roll Style Instagram Roll (4 Stars) - Trendy roll with good sauce  Very trendy place with good lighting and good young atmosphere.  

                It was good until I bit into the tempura shrimp.   It kind of ruined the whole experience. It tasted like old refried shrimp.  My wife said the same thing. It would be a shame that such a popular place would try to save money by serving old shrimp.  I can see that you care about your food and your service.   It must have been a very rare mistake perhaps.   I am sure my next visit there will be just as enjoyable as the first time I had dined there.  

                FRESH! I came here for the first time with the intent of getting the Chirashi bowl, and that's what I did. Very impressed with the freshness. Big cuts too, I took half of it home because I got full. Paired well with hot sake.  Free app with a check in on yelp which is nice. Spicy garlic edamame got tiring to eat, and it may have been overlooked. Gave a complementary little crab crunch starter thing too. Can't argue with free.  Ultimately, I'd recommend. I haven't tried the rolls yet, but the fresh fish alone sold me.  

                I was a sake virgin until my friend and I went here. I'm now officially a fan of hot sake - although to me it's way better if you keep it piping hot, which means you'd better keep drinking it as soon as it gets poured out.  Sundays are ALL-DAY HAPPY HOUR! I guess that means Happy Day, right? It surely is -- two large hot sakes, soft-shell crab appetizer, three orders of maki sushi, two special rolls AND dessert for under $70 for two people. That's a pretty sweet deal.  Sushi is fresh, service is good - what more can you ask for in a Japanese restaurant? Been twice now, enjoyed it equally both times.  

                I'll admit it. I'm a sushi snob. But living in NY and LA and traveling a lot, I have a right to be. Never being to this area, I went smoky based off reviews.   Sushi, fresh. Very fresh. Portions are huge. Presentation is awesome. Every time I come back into the area, this is a must stop for me. These guys are chefs. They know how to use a variety of different flavors to truly hit every part of your pallet. The flavors blend perfectly, everything is balanced.   Oh and BTW, the Sophia Mango Mac roll might be the best signature roll I've ever had, period.  

                My nephew swears by this place and after my first visit, i can totally see why.   We decided to skip the normal Steak House for Valentines dinner and opted to come here. We pulled up and notice a huge group of people standing around, waiting to be seated. Sucks for us but it's definitely a good sign right??  The hosts in the front were courteous and very helpful even under all of the hectic circumstances. We asked that we be seated in a booth and told them that we would be okay with a longer wait. This place was jam packed and if you didn't already make reservations or didn't care to sit at the bar: you were pretty much out of luck. I lost count of all the walk ins that ended up walking out immediately because the wait was purely insane.   So we finally get seated and we start off by redeeming our free appetizer through checking in on yelp. We originally wanted the calamari but this apparently wasn't redeemable with the yelp offer so we ended up with the spicy garlic edamame. It promised spice with a garlic twist. It came out hot (in temp) and definitely garlicky but the heat was no where to be found... meh.  I expected more and was kind of left unsatisfied so we called for an order of calamari. At first glance, the calamari was not as appealing to me as i had hoped. The fried squid consists of rings and only rings, none of the delicious tentacles that i always look forward to munching on. It wasn't anything spectacular and for $9 i felt like i've had better elsewhere. The dipping sauce was delicious but not good enough for me to order this again.   We also ordered: "Oh My God!" RoLL (OMG)- the roll consisted of shrimp tempura, avocado, and crab. It is then topped off with battered and deep fried Langostino (similar to mini Lobster) and tobiko. Do be aware of the heavy, thick batter that the Langostino is fried in. its not for the faint of heart.  Aniki's ULtimate Roll- the roll was filled with shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and crab. It is topped off with chunks of salmon, tuna, hamachi, onion, and avocado.  & Last but not Least, we got the Sashimi Regular- which is the chef's choice of 12 pieces of Sashimi  Downside: they ran our of uni and quail egg. I was really looking forward to this off the menu sashimi dish that my nephew was raving about and a good amount of the ingredients weren't available. We were also looking forward to our complimentary Valentines day cupcakes but they ended up running out of that too. Boo!!! We spent well over a hundred bucks and didn't get any sweets.  Food was amazing and the presentation for each dish was stunning to say the very least. The customer service was great even though the restaurant was a mad house. Special thanks to our server Johnathan- my cup of tea never went empty. We really appreciate how helpful you were. Thank You to Abdul for his quick response to my yelp account in regards to the shortage of cupcakes- it truly shows how important your customer base is.  There is no doubt in my mind that i will be back here for my sushi fix. Maybe then i can try that uni, egg, and sashimi dish. I look forward to updating my review and giving them at least one more extra star.... because i know they can prove to me that they are worthy of it.  

                I've been here twice now and I have to say it's a solid place for sushi, but it's only a solid place for sushi.   I ordered a spider man roll and nabeyaki udon; my boyfriend ordered Aniki's ultimate, the kruz3r mob BC roll and the poke trio. The rolls were all great! The poke was actually pretty good as well! The fish was fresh and really packed a lot of flavor! I would come back for the sushi/poke any day. BUT their udon was not that good. I wouldn't say it's terrible, but it lacked so many things. The broth wasn't flavorful, just salty. Also, my chicken looked normal, but tasted like it has been sitting on the grill for 4 hours; literally, all I tasted was smoke. The egg was still raw..... I had to scoop it out with my spoon.... There were also a lack of vegetables. Maybe i was wrong to come here thinking their other menu items would be as good as their sushi/poke.   I think it's a really solid place for sushi! I can tell they have really fresh fish. It also looks really nice because the slices are so nicely marbled! It's like you're eating little pieces of art. But anyways, stick to the fish related menu items.  

                Mmmm...   I approve ! Although I am a lover of the nigiri only and i am spoiled by another place . Lol I do sometimes enjoy the rolls and this place to my surprise was yummy .   The decoration was beautiful but most importantly the flavors were there and I didn't feel like I was shoving down rice with some weird sauce . Everything tasted pretty fresh .  Service was great too. I think I would totally go here over cha cha any day since I  feel like that place has gone down hill ;(  So overall if you want just specialty rolls come here. Not so much for the sashimi or nigiri.  

                This is truly the best Sashimi in Fremont.  Again, strictly rating for the edible art of sashimi and not the cooked items.  As always, I asked for the sashimi omakase.  Always beautiful, always fresh.  Check the pictures and see for yourself.  One of my favorite appetizer is the Japanese nacho (tempura shiso leave with spicy tuna on top).  Delish! As I know the wait staff fairly well, we were seated very quickly.  Service is always solid as well.  The bathroom? Good.  A little walk and the walk way is a slippery if you are trotting around in 3 inch heals.  But, it's a nice restroom.  The bill for 3 was $80.  Not too bad for the sashimi.  Overall experience?  Solid lunch and solid dinner.  Bon appetite!  Until next time, ciao!  

                This place never disappoints.  Everything from their appetizers to dessert is good.   Today I was in a hurry so I just got a Roses Seafood Salad.  It was <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bomb.com</a>. Really good and fresh. The only thing I would personally change is one of the fish in the salad had a strong fish flavor. I don't know another way to describe it other than fishy. So if I get that again, I will likely ask to not have that fish in there. But that is all personal preference.   Drinks: Sake.  The sake is amazing. Not all sake has a great sake taste. But this one is on point.   Food: Ive gotten their complementary crab salad thing you get when you dine in, and it honestly makes me just want to dine in all the time. But I don't usually have the time.  We also got a free appetizer of spicy garlic Edamame.  If you don't instagram, maybe you should download the app and post a picture just to get this for free. or stop being a cheap ass and buy it because damn it, this was too good!   Rolls: One of my favorite rolls is the OMG roll. Its just perfect. You get a good amount of tempura goodness with the accompaniment of a delicious roll.   Poki salads: If you're a fan of poki, get the trio! Its worth it.   Dessert: I have only tried one so far, it was the fried banana and ice cream. I dont regret one bite. It was way too good. I kept seeing that dish come out of the kitchen so i had to order one for myself. :p No regrets!   Service: Outstanding. They always greet you upon arrival and are usually really soft spoken. Servers are nice and attentive as well as having a lot of knowledge of the menu. So if you come in and are overwhelmed by their 8 page menu, just ask a server what they prefer or what is popular. Can't go wrong. I have yet to have something that it outright disgusting.  Defiantly a place to go.   Con: Their prices are a bit high. but they do have really good quality and the food always looks like what you see in the pictures.  So if you want to get cheap sushi, don't come here.  If I made more money, I would live here.  

                All my friends have rav reviews about Aniki's, but it was okay for me.  I guess it depends on what you ordered? We ordered the famous Sooki roll and the typical rainbow roll (but with a different name on the menu). The Sooki roll was creative and delicious, but it was wrapped very loosely so everything fell apart. The other row was pretty disappointing and unmemorable: the inside was like Costco's roll. Usually the typical rainbow roll I have in other restaurants at least also have some sort of fish inside...and for the price it was pretty expensive. :(  On the bright side, all the fish tasted pretty fresh, maybe I'll consider getting sashimi or chirashi if I am coming back next time...  

                Now that Yuki's has a different sushi chef that has changed their sushi, and they have somehow lost the ability to cook sushi rice properly, I have to say that I've been finding myself at Aniki's much more frequently to get my sushi fish.  It's still by no means a traditional Japanese restaurant, but if you're looking for huge rolls and big portions, this is a good option. They can get really busy on weekends, so be prepared to wait if you don't have a reservation.   Their non-edible garnishes still kind of irk me. They are totally pretty, but it means that they are either buying, then throwing away a leaf and a flower for every plate that they serve, or they are picking them off the dishes, rinsing them off and reusing them.   I think that they could knock a dollar or two off their rolls and ditch the flowers and pass the savings onto us.  

                I like the aniki's because of the Sake selection. The fish is good but to be very honest nothing in the area has come close to Omee J in Sunnyvale.   The cuts of fish were good, normal size you'd see at a sushi joint. The rolls were also good but I noticed a lot of the rolls are lathered in sauces...which just takes away the flavors of the fish itself.  but the sake list...impressive. The waitress we had was also impressive because she actually knew the sakes they carried well and could discuss the flavors, bouquet and more (like pairing) with ease..so ordering sake with sushi was perfect.  All in all, this is a good place to eat. Be prepared to wait if you didn't call first because everytime we've done a walk in..its been a 30-45 min wait min.  I'd also avoid this place on Friday and Sat nights between 8-10 as its usually packed with a nice line  

                Went to Aniki's Sushi for dinner on Wednesday night at 8 pm. The place was packed but we were seated right away. The menu is extensive with two pages of different rolls. There are some Korean items on the menu as well. We ordered the Omakase which consisted the following  monk fish liver geoduck clam raw octopus salmon with salmon eggs albacore tuna with uni on top  The fish selection is basic but the presentation. We also had the Japanese Nachos which were complimentary with Yelp check in and was excellent. The Tempura however was very heavy and greasy. Service was OK.  

                I love my sushi and I am picky when going to places. I have to admit that his place is great. Great service, great food and ambiance.  Sushi is fresh and love the cucumber salad.  I usually go on my lunch hour and am in and out in time. Go and check it out!  

                This is by FAR the best sushi restaurant in the Bay! We come here regularly (every Friday) and we arrive right at 5pm when they open to avoid waiting. The food is always fresh and delicious! Some of our favorites are the Japanese Nachos, Aniki's Delight, Spicy Tuna hand roll, Pixie Roll, Charlie Chaplain Roll, OMG roll and the BBQ spicy chicken plate. The staff is always so helpful and friendly and the restaurant is always clean. Aniki's has set the bar so high that I refuse to eat at any other sushi joint! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  

                This is a really nice looking sushi place. Once you walk in, you get that upscale and expensive feel.. so of course it feels like the food here is less than authentic and tailored more to the American public...at least that's how I felt. Nothing wrong with a wow looking sushi restaurant... But the food was not so wow!  Before I picked this restaurant, I was excited to see that they were offering a free appetizer with a check in on Yelp. Don't be fooled though, it's just edamame or seaweed salad...nothing to be too excited about. I guess what made up for it was the free crab salad they give each guest in the beginning.   The rolls here were kinda pricey for the taste/quality. I mean the rolls looked decent, but they weren't as good as they looked. Our group had the following: 1.) Simba Roll - Deep fried tempura, yummy. Roll was simple and pretty decent.  2.) OMG Roll- There was nothing "OMG" about this roll. It had some deep fried fish on top and underneath was a variation of a California roll. Very very disappointed.  3.) Kruzer mob roll - This was probably the prettiest roll, but it didn't taste all that great. I don't think it was very fresh either. 4.) Aniki's roll - This I would recommend if you like tuna... its loaded with tuna. The roll underneath was better than that of the OMG roll.  Anyway, service was also okay. I noticed there was a pretty big wait staff so you always have someone there to tend to your needs. I don't know if I'd come back to this place for sushi though. I think Satomi is a lot better.  

                Aniki's Sushi really lived up to the hype. Their reviews are glowing and after my recent dining experience there, I can totally see why. The service was exceptional and the food was flavorful and delicious.  We ordered the Dragon roll and Teriyaki chicken dinner combo. The portion for the combo was large but matches the $18 price tag. The dragon roll was another $13 for a larger than average sized roll. We also got to sample some of their large selection of sake. They were unfortunately out of the one I originally wanted to get, but were very apologetic and polite about it -- offering us a few samples before I picked an alternative.   We also got a free Japanese nachos appetizer, which only came with two pieces but were really unique and tasty. There was also a starter salad made with panko crumbs and sauce. Everything was so delicious! (See mouth-watering pictures below)  Our waitress was very nice throughout our dinner and there was another guy walking around constantly to make sure that the tables are cleared when they can be and that our waters are filled. The best thing about their service is that they have plenty of servers to take care of their customers' needs right away.   There is also a small bar area inside for those who just want to drink sake and have sushi (:  

                You know you're close to heaven when you get sushi with Bacon on it! Delicious Fresh  And amazing service! The OMG baby lobster is to die for and the salmon is the freshest I've had in a long time!  A must try place  

                As a vegetarian, I know to not to come to a Sushi place and expect a wide variety of vegetarian options. But I think I like the appetizer salad that they served here first. They have a mango/ jalapeno roll which is pretty good. And I see that they have some rolls that they set on fire, so that's pretty cool. We also get a free appetizer with a Yelp check-in so that's cool. One of the sushi places I would go to if I ever craved vegetarian sushi or lived in fremont.  

                1 hr wait, small crowded, great service good food, pricey, great guava cake, good rolls :)  

                The wait was a bit long but that's what you would expect?  It's really good and very creative rolls. Our order was taken by the manager Carlos. Our server was hit with 3 tables all at once so we understood. Carlos came by and took our orders and even recommended a roll not on the menu. He really took care of us and Vesna, our other server came by as well. The service was outstanding and the food was amazing. Definitely would go back and try other rolls. We have yet to try the poke. Too full.....  

                This place is the shit. My family and I come here at least once a week!  Pro tip: The wait for a table sometimes gets pretty long. My Parents and I have learned that the bar is the way to go if you want to get seated right away! Plus it's really fun and entertaining to watch the sushi chefs prepare the rolls.  But I love this place! Super fresh fish. A little bit more on the expensive side but I prefer it over Satomi which my family and I used to go to all the time, but we've made the switch considering their fish is far more superior.   Japanese Nachos - Seems like everyone raves about them. They're so delicious, and awesome that they're free! Drench in lemon, yummm.  Hamachi Kama - This is an appetizer but I normally eat is as my main course. It is the neck of hamachi, grilled. Super tasty with the dipping sauce!  Kim's Poke Trio - Love this sampler style dish, which I also have as my main course sometimes. Super flavorful and unique tastes.  My only slight annoyance with this place is that some of their rolls are just too fancy! There are some superfluous things in them which jack up the prices. Wish they'd take away some rolls and add some more simple ones. I guess that's why I normally opt out of the rolls and grab some fish instead!  

                My husband and I have been wanting to try this for the longest time! We tried a Monday, but Aniki's is closed... Bummer.   So we went in on the 7th, my bday! I was so excited To come in for lunch. We also wanted to see what the hype was all about. We got a free appetizer when you check in with Yelp; we ordered the "Nachos". They were like two crispy "chips" with stuff on top. We also got a complimentary crunchy crab "salad" very small with cucumbers. but very tasty. So tasty that we had to order my son a plate for himself (he seriously only eats the crunchy stuff and crab: not sure what you call the crunchy stuff. Sue me! I'm Ignorant lol )   Service was great; very attentive.   We ordered 3 different rolls: The Sophia Mac Roll was delicious, the Philadelphia Roll, pretty standard, and the Captain "something" I'm not Gonna lie, I forgot the name! Hey, I went there last weekend! Lol   All rolls very yummy.  I'm not into fresh fish too much so I can't ding them for that. I will, however, ding them 1 star because it's pricey! I'm not a cheap person nor is my husband, but I was definitely only looking to order rolls under $15... we will be back again, but this is a once in a while treat.  Glad we came in.  

                This place is above average but is a bit overpriced. A free app with check in was a nice great plus some complimentary crab salad and Miso for kids.. But My citrus breeze was nothing but grapefruit juice...;( portions were large... But $20 for a poke (lightly marinated fish and shaved raffish) was a little much..  

                Our favorite is the OMG roll...great service, great food and music is great....old school!  

                Seems like when ever the the Hubby and I are craving sushi we always end up here. So where to start..first off I love the music they have on! It ranges from 80's hits to 90's R&B always takes me back...but I digress.   When you check in on Yelp you get to pick a free appetizer and our favorite is the Japanese nachos. They also serve a yummy complimentary crunch salad which has crab, spicy mayo, cucumber and bits of fried tempura flakes.   The rolls are a bit on the pricey side at about $10-$20 a roll. I will say though the fish is very fresh. We haven't been disappointed yet! Our favorites are the:  Instagram Roll: Salmon, yamagobo, spicy tuna, avacado, unagi   Aniki's Ultimate Roll: Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, crab   Gonzo Neo traditional Roll: Soft shell crab, asparagus, cucumber, spicy tuna, tobiko  The service here is friendly and fast. So big thing is this place is always busy! We usually wait about 30-45 mins, it helps if you have a larger party to make a reservation in advance.  

                *Check-in on Yelp for a free appetizer per table. Recommend the nachos!  I finally got to try Aniki's last time I was in the bay after my friends have been raving about this place. It was overhyped for me.  Atmosphere: Busy and crowded during dinner time. They must be doing something right if they're constantly drawing in crowds. Apparently, 49ers players enjoy coming here to eat.  Parking: Inside a plaza, so free and plentiful.  Food: I shared with 2 of my friends. We ordered two different rolls, OMG and Ultimate, which were both okay. One was fried lobsters and the other was seared fish over california roll. 2 salmon nigiri and 2 uni nigiri which were good sized! I think Cha Cha Sushi is cheaper and gives more in quantity. It was plenty of food for us. Each of us paid $20 including the tax and tip.  

                It was my first time here and my experience left me with a desire to return. Each one of those stars is genuinely earned by Aniki's.  I was greeted by server who was not empty handed. They bring you a complimentary appitizer, small cucumber salad with spicy mayo, crab meat and tempura crumbled concoction.   I came in craving a cooked roll, and discovered how fresh* the sashimi was. And it was 8pm! I ordered salmon and tuna nigiri, immediately. They were good!   The cooked roll was a bit cold for my taste, but I think they might have been trying not to over cook the salmon. It wasn't over the top delectable but it was an enjoyable typical spin on a 'lion roll' nontheless.  The unagi hand roll was good, it was moist but could use a bit more flavor. I would like to try the Donburi.   This place had the freshest ginger ever tasted. Asking for extra a generous helping is given.  My waiter was super attentive and relaxed, my tea kept getting refilled, and I love getting my sushi straight from the hands of the chef.   This place defined 'fully staffed.'  I recommend sitting at the bar.  

                Not too expensive and always have fresh salmon shasimi- my favorite! Recommend.*thumb up*  

                Aniki Sushi is the best. I could not believe that in Fremont I found this place. It is in the middle of a random shopping center. I checked in and saw the free app offer for yelp. It was the japenese nachos- so delicious. It was a deep friend leaf that was the "chip" with a generous amount of yummy on top. Then I got a rainbow roll and the OMG roll. The OMG roll was GIGANTIC. It was overflowing with fried lobster on top. I could have shared it with 3 people. What a deal.  They give you an amuse bouche when you sit down and thefree yelp check in! I am in love and so sad that I do not live near this sushi place. You lucky Fremontians. There are booths and tables galore and it is no surprise that they are busy.  

                Had sushi deluxe combo. ~40$ but enough for 2 ppl and the selection of fish was supreme. Hamachi belly and tuna belly included but no tamago and ebi. Fresh fish. My husband is sensitive to freshness of fish but he approved this place so far. Best in fremont so far I know. 30min even on wednesday nights says something about this place. It is worth the wait. Waitresses were a bit busy but they were all nice. Had fusiony feeling about this restaurant but nothing disappointed me so far. Highly recommend for fremont and nearby residents. I used to go all the way to Santa Clara or SF to eat sushi but this place made stay in town for sushi on weekday nights.  

                Flavorful and different rolls that make them stand out. They have a large variety of rolls and their menu has pictures!! Their free crab salad is pretty tasty too! I craved this place when I was pregnant. This is my go to sushi restaurant. :)  

                I've been to this sushi place a handful of times!   I came on their 2nd anniversary because I heard they have a photo booth set up and cute sushi cupcakes!!! Definitely took advantage of the photo booth and took 3 sets! 2 while waiting and 1 after dinner! :)  I have to say that this place looks pretty nice inside the restaurant and the staff is usually pretty great, but the sushi is on the pricier side. :p  I really think the sushi here is just okay... Nothing really special so I don't think it's really worth the price :p   The sashimi here is thick and delicious though! And the best free appetizer if you check into yelp is the Japanese Nachos! It's a deep fried leaf with spicy tuna mmmm :9 def must get!  The bathroom is really nice so A+ for that! This place is usually really busy so tables are pretty close to others...   One time I came with 5 friends and we ordered a carafe of soju expecting something on the larger side... So not worth it. Lols should have been shown the size because we asked how many shots would that carafe held. It poured less than 10 shots! :p  

                I got here at around 8:45pm on a Friday night and there was still a short wait.  Aniki is popular amongst the younger, ghettoer Asian crowd... you know, e-cigs, baggy jeans, and slang.  Yes, some people still wear baggy jeans.  If you check in, you get "Japanese nachos" which are two deep fried sesame leaves topped with tuna and the fixings.  Ours took a while to came out and the waitress told us the leaves were still being deep fried, which I'm sure does not take more than 2 minutes each.  But it turns out she forgot to put our order in.  She was really nice about it though.  The thing to get here are rolls.  They have two huge pages of them and they're sort of organized under cooked, tempura, and specialty sections.  They even have super special rolls, one with king crab that cost $30.  I don't know who in their right mind would pay $30 for that.  If you want king crab, get the actual thing in its entirety and get it fresh.  Generally, the rolls are a bit pricey for what you get.  The fish does seem moderately fresh but all the rolls we got had a lot of sauce and it was just too overpowering or too salty or too sweet.  Service was good and the food came out quick.  There's one TV set on a sports channel.  There's a bar in the back that has lights constantly changing color.  Booths along the walls and a lot of closely set tables in the middle.  A little too close for comfort at times.  

                My best friend took me here for my late birthday dinner (lol). Sushi dinners seem to have become our thing recently, and we are always wanting to try new places! Anyways, we have never been to Aniki's, but he swore on the previous reviews that it would be a good place for sushi. I have to say I'm very impressed!  Came on a Friday night and we were sat right away. We checked in and got ourselves a free appetizer -- their Japanese nachos. Two, bite-sized "nachos" that wanted me having more! Very interesting combination of ingredients and textures. Never had anything like it.   The rolls. I ordered the Sooki So So (love cucumber rolls) and Instagram roll. My friend ordered the Fremont Fire, Simba, and some garlic shrimp roll (can't remember the name!) The Instagram had to have been my favorite out of the five, but they were all pretty damn good.   When we first opened up the Fremont Fire roll, I quickly spotted a hair on it... Eek! Told our waitress, and she took it back to the kitchen to be remade. She came back with a new roll (hair free!) and said it was taken off the bill! Definitely was not expecting that, but we appreciated the gesture! And hey, who can argue with free sushi?!   To drink, my friend had a beer, and I got the plumtini as recommended by our waitress. REALLY good! The best part of the night? The manager surprised us a with second round of drinks... on the house! It was his way of apologizing for the hairy situation.   All in all, I would definitely come back. Good food&drinks, great employees, and awesome music.  

                Hands down, best Sushi in Fremont for sure, however they are expensive.  You sit down and are first served with a lovely little cucumber and crab salad and service from the gate is incredible. I used to get the rolls, but lately I have been ordering the salmon skin hand roll and it is just wonderful!  The skin is cooked to perfection giving it a light chew which is how I like it.  It is also pretty large, so very filling.  The Japanese nachos are also amazing, very unique and the flavors combine nicely.  I ordered the jalapeno bombs once too, great flavor, super freaking spicy though!  Buyer beware!  

                Updated review as of 08/09/2014:  Thank you Abdul, Rob, & the whole staff at Aniki's for never disappointing me. I've been coming here since they first opened earlier last year. I've never ONCE had any disappointments with my food or service and I hope to see this business continue to grow everyday.  So far since I started coming here, I've tried: - Golden State Warrior Roll. - OMG Roll. - SAV's Roll. (If you usually go to Cha Cha Sushi and always get the Brandon Roll then you have to try this. It's a similar concept but bigger portions!) - King Crab Roll.  - Cisco System Roll. - Lion King Roll. - Raiders Roll. - Kruzer Roll. - 49ers Roll. - Facebook Roll. - Sophia Mango Mac Roll. - Sashimi Deluxe. - Mussels. - Nigiri Omakase. (This one is probably my favorite because it has uni, quail egg, and a bunch of sashimi around it.) - Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream.  Some of the things here might be pricey but it's definitely worth your money AND it's quality sushi!   Tips: If you check in on Yelp, you can get a free appetizer and all of it is good!
