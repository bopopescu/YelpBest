                Updated review as of 08/09/2014:  Thank you Abdul, Rob, & the whole staff at Aniki's for never disappointing me. I've been coming here since they first opened earlier last year. I've never ONCE had any disappointments with my food or service and I hope to see this business continue to grow everyday.  So far since I started coming here, I've tried: - Golden State Warrior Roll. - OMG Roll. - SAV's Roll. (If you usually go to Cha Cha Sushi and always get the Brandon Roll then you have to try this. It's a similar concept but bigger portions!) - King Crab Roll.  - Cisco System Roll. - Lion King Roll. - Raiders Roll. - Kruzer Roll. - 49ers Roll. - Facebook Roll. - Sophia Mango Mac Roll. - Sashimi Deluxe. - Mussels. - Nigiri Omakase. (This one is probably my favorite because it has uni, quail egg, and a bunch of sashimi around it.) - Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream.  Some of the things here might be pricey but it's definitely worth your money AND it's quality sushi!   Tips: If you check in on Yelp, you can get a free appetizer and all of it is good!
