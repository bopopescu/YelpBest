                The service was terrible, after waiting for several minutes, I had get up and get my own menu. I ordered the fish tacos, horrible! The corn tortillas were cold and almost hard, the"pickled," cabbage was flavorless, and the portion size was very small, ESPECIALLY for the price. My daughter ordered a burger and she became I'll because of the food handling, cook's dirty hands? I don't know but she was sick until the next afternoon! The total bill was $40 for a horrible meal. Stay away, stay far , stay dar away. Was so not worth the money, wish I could get a refund.
