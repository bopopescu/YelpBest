                For the 10 yrs I had lived in Vallejo, and the thousands of times I had past by this true neighborhood market, I had NEVER gone in until yesterday. Being hungry and having an urge for a good sandwich, I turned to Yelp for help. And lo and behold the first option was the food basket! And I was like, "really"? Well, I was thoroughly impressed by the selection of products, of the markets cleanliness and the friendly staff. Oh, and the sandwich? I will drive from Fairfield to Vallejo just for the jerk chicken!
