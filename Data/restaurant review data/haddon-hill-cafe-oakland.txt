                So glad that these guys took over my local coffee shop which, once, could be described as "terrible." In the last few years, the new owners (so local, I believe, they live two doors down) offer top notch coffee in a lovely setting. Today, some dude was playing mournful tunes on a piano--how lovely! Their choice of pastries and snacks is also well thought-out.
