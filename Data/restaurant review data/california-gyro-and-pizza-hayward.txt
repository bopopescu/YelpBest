                The food was ok nothing special. They say their platters come with rice, salad and pita bread. I ordered my food to go and when I got home there was no pita bread, a tiny salad and barely any meat. I didn't pay $13 to get a bunch of rice. I think I'll try the Oasis grill near my house instead.
