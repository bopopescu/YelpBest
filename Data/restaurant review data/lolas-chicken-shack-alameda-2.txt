                Wow, another Alameda secret surprise.  Been wanting to try Lola's for a while since it took over the Bonaire bakery spot int he middle of Park St.  Chicken, hummmm.  So the wife and I went tonight.  I was expecting fried chicken like KFCs or Popeyes so was a little off guard looking the menu.  They have salads but we came for the chicken so chicken we ordered.  Wife had a chicken sandwich but can't remember which one.  It looked real good and she said it was pretty tasty.  Not her all time favorite but real good.  Combo meal with the Lola's mac and a drink.  I decided I had to have the tenders, so ordered the 5 piece. Strawberry BBQ and BBQ dipping sauces.  TVs on the walls.  Plenty of tables, nice and clean.  Nice environment.  Out came the food.  Pleasantly surprised how much food there was.  The Lola's mac was in a full size bowl - was expecting a little macaroni salad.  Big macaronis, great flavor.  Large portion of fries, crispy on the outside, really good.  The tenders are large pieces of fresh chicken with no preservatives.  They buy all their chicken fresh and its real chicken meat.  No beaks, bones or feet here.  Sandwich was also good size.  We couldn't eat half of it, so took the rest home.  Lola's is the Anti-MickeyD's andAnti-KFC when it comes to chicken.  Good fresh food, reasonable prices, nice friendly service.  If its fresh chicken you want, try Lola's.
