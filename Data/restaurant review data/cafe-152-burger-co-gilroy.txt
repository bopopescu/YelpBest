                "If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face" should be Cafe 152 Burger's motto (no offense Carl's Jr)!  I ordered the Baja Burger and my s/o got the Big Roy; both so good and super messy! And you can taste the better quality.  We ordered our meals as combos (which I think it would have been cheaper to share 1 soda and get 2 separate sides) with garlic fries and onion rings. Good God, the garlic fries are awesome, but I would prefer it to be cooked longer before adding in the garlic.  Caf√© 152 is a couple blocks down from the Outlets in a parking lot shared with other businesses.  I think this will be our new lunch spot while were in/passing Gilroy.
