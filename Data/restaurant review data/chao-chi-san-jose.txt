                For what you get, it's definitely good. It really is better than your typical steam table Chinese food. I saw them load up several of the trays with freshly-made dishes while I was waiting. The proof of freshness was pretty much right there.  The people behind the counter are also very cool, loading up your tray, giving you samples of everything, generally taking care of you much more than you'd expect at one of these places.  Salt & pepper chicken was my favorite item. It looks like your typical fried fast-food Chinese chicken dish. One bite and you realize it's so much more than that.  The place is a DIVE. Don't actually eat here, just get your food and go.
