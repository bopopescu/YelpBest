                OMG...I've been meaning to try this place for ages and I finally got to try it for Sunday dinner with my family. Â UN-FREAKING-BELIEVEABLE.  There's is not much I can say but YOU'VE GOT TO EAT HERE!!!!  If I lived in Berkeley, I'd be a fat cow because I would be eating at Angeline's EVERYDAY!!!!!   The only complaint I had about this place was I couldn't stay to eat more!!!!
