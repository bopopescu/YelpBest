                OG Sliders is the perfect restaurant for you if you like food that is 50 shades of organic but manages to be tasteless and dramatically overpriced.  The first thing you notice when you walk into the restaurant is that everything looks new and nice, like a rustic old bar with an extremely modern edge (artsy chalkboards and everything).   The second thing you notice is the music. It is inescapable. No corner of the restaurant is quiet. This might have been alright if the music was even as close to the stylishness of the decor, but (at least while I was there) the playlist seemed to be entirely annoying a capella covers of equally annoying pop songs.  I ordered the Beef Sliders and asked for everything, but specifically the cheese, on the side. Naturally, the cheese arrived melted onto the burger patty. They were very gracious about bringing me the corrected dish, which unfortunately did not save the dish from being bland and generic. While not entirely inedible, I really did not enjoy eating the burgers, and did it mostly because I paid $10 for them.  I ordered a side of onion rings ($4.75), which were sort-of alright tasting but only 5 rings came in my order. If you don't feel like doing math, that's 95 cents for each onion ring. Again, another dish I only finished because of how expensive it was.  One place where OG Sliders does shine is in its milkshakes. I got the TCHO chocolate milkshake and it was an absolute delight. If for some reason you find yourself here, get one.  Overall, I'm probably never coming back here again (unless I'm craving an expensive milkshake), and I can't honestly recommend it. I'd strongly encourage saving/donating your money and taking your business to another burger joint.
