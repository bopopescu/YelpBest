                Four of us ate there last night and all of us enjoyed our entire meal.  I had the Seafood Spinach Gnocchi.  It was STUPENDOUS!  The gnocchi were light as air, unlike any I've ever had before.  There were about 4 large shrimp and maybe 4 large scallops that were cut into smaller pieces making more like 13 or 14 small bites of scallops.  The sauce was a light curry-flavored sauce - not spicy hot though.  I'd never had curry flavor with seafood and the mix of gnocchi, seafood and the sauce was perfection.  I asked our waitress if the gnocchi were house made and she said yes, so I am VERY impressed.  I don't live anywhere NEAR this place but the next time I'm down in the Napa area for ANY reason I will go here!  As much as I wanted to eat my entire plate of gnocchi, I saved back a bit for a 'doggie bag' so I could take some home to enjoy one more time!   Oh, by the way, the house 'soup' was a hearty vegetable with kale, zucchini, carrots, broccoli, and possibly a few other obviously fresh vegetables in a lovely tomatoey broth.  It was served with toasted French bread that was sprinkled with some parmesan cheese and possibly a touch of garlic.  We ate every bit of it too.   Two at our table ordered the Scallop Sliders.  Hmmm - they both agreed that the flavor was great (a nice 'sauce' on the slider too) but the sliders were too thick and the bread crumbled as they ate it. They would have preferred to have the scallops served on a piece of that nice toasted bread to eat with a knife and fork.     Our waitress was very nice and attentive too.  We had a wonderful experience and would recommend this place.  The only thing keeping me from giving this the 5-star rating was the fact that the sliders bread fell apart as my co-diners tried to eat it.
