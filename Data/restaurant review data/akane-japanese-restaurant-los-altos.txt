                This is one of the best sushi restaurants in the PA or Los Altos area. I have eaten here for lunch at least 12 times and the food and service is excellent. One special item they do is the Snapper Nigiri  it is excellent. I have taken out of town Japanese business men here  often and they really liked this place - a testament to the fine preparation and high quality seafood.  

                I was staying in the Palo Alto Marriott and had a craving for sushi so I came across this nice little restaurant.  Although this place is a bit on the pricey end, I thought the fish is really fresh and just simply awesome.     **Place** The location is pretty small but we dropped by around 730 pm on a Tuesday night and we're seated immediately.   Parking is located near the Charles Schwab office.     **food** We started with the tofu for appetizers.   This isn't too bad actually.   The tofu skin is pretty crispy which goes well with the sauce (the sauce is a little on the salty side).     I then ordered the Akane roll 2.  To be honest, I was not a big fan of their roll.   I thought it was plain and that it did not jump out on you.     Hamachi Roll - I actually do recommend getting the Hamachi roll.   It's really good and tasty.    Mixed Sashimi - this is on the pricey side but it's really good.   The fish is fresh and it includes salmon, tuna, yellowtail, albacore, and white fish.     **Service** The service is solid here.  They checked up on us frequently.  

                Impersonal and hurried wait staff.   Small portion.  It took about 8 minutes to get water after I was seated and 3 minutes after they took my order and brought it with the ice and told her three mins ago for no ice.  These little things ad up when you pay $24 for Chirashi and get 8 small pieces and 2 magoro.  I got a eight pickled sprouts for a free apatizer, (A Korean influence I suspect) and a hot towel; I don't give a crap about either of these if I leave hungry after paying $24 for average tasting sushi. :(  My stomach is literally growling as I write this in the parking lot.  I wanted to order more but was concerned with overall value.  I would have gone with star if the place looked like a dump.  Skip this place.    To the manager or owner: just because you're in DT Los Altos, don't rest on your laurels.  Maybe give a free small miso or a salad with that baby Chirashi.  

                Definitely my favorite sushi spot in Los Altos. It's true that they are pricey, but the quality of fish is always high. Service is fast & friendly. I've always gone for lunch so I'm not sure what dinner entails. The restaurant itself is a clean traditional style Japanese restaurant. They offer all of the standard bento box lunches, udon, sushi, & sashimi. My personal favorite is their hamachi sashimi, I order it every time. You have the option of a small 4 piece order or large 8 piece. I am also a fan of their various rolls. Akane keeps things simple & doesn't offer many varieties of rolls, but what they have is tasty enough. Great little spot if you're in the area.  

                HANDS DOWN THE WORST - RUDE- SERVICE IN WORLD. And it all starts with the Owner Chef! He is belittling and ignores his clientele. He should be ashamed of himself the most horrible manners. Don't go there if you want to be a respected customer..Akane specializes in RUDE and OBNOXCIOUS service.  

                Came here for lunch with the good reviews and people in the mood for sushi. We were seated right away with lunch special menus. Half of us wanted sushi so asked for that menu, which is a list of rolls and nigiri with a checklist.  We ordered a bunch, prices are standard, but the waiter came back to say they were out of hamachi! NOOO! He offered a similar fish, but it was not good at all. The fish was decently fresh, but not what I am used to at other restaurants. The spicy scallop was my favorite. Our waiter forgot our 2 orders of eel nigiri and when I reminded him, he had no idea, but it came out pretty quick.  Overall, service is good, and a good lunch spot, but have had way better sushi.  

                I came here rather unexpectedly last night with some friends. After reading many of the yelp reviews, I was concerned that I was in for an expensive dinner and that, with many people mentioning small portions, I may not even be full. Akane proved me wrong. Yes, it's a little on the pricier side, but the quality of the food is SO worth it (and it was certainly enough food).  For four of us, we ordered: 1. Chawan Mushi - my first time having Japanese egg custard - it was super smooth and tasty, but a bit on the watery side. My friend (who really KNOWS her Japanese food and culture) said that it was good but she's had better.  2. Salmon, Tuna, and Avocado Tartare - it came with this sauce that you pour all over it, then smash it together to mix. Surprisingly, it is served with Lay's potato chips - just dip and eat - almost like ceviche! Let me tell you, though, this was SO DELICIOUS. It was full of flavor and freshness and definitely packed with a LOT of fish. I would order this again in a heartbeat.  3. Assorted Sashimi - there were 14 pieces of 6 or 7 different kinds of fish. I honestly can't remember everything that was on there, but I'm pretty sure there was aji, hamachi, tuna, and white tuna (and some others...but I can't remember). They were all so fresh and delicious - you could seriously TASTE the freshness in each bite. The standout of all of the fish was the white tuna - lightly seared on the outside, but the inside just melts in your mouth. SO GOOD.  3. Unagi bento box - OMG. The unagi just melted in my mouth. Seriously - there was barely a need to chew because it was soooooo tender and tasty. It came presented, literally, in a covered bento box - very beautiful presentation; even better taste.  4. Akane Roll II - this roll was super yummy - I think it has tombo inside and is covered with tempura flakes on the outside. Nice and light.  5. Unagi Avocado Roll - maybe I'm just on an unagi roll (haha, pun intended), but this unagi was heavenly. Just and wonderfully delicious as the bento box and certainly the best roll we ordered. I want more unagi just thinking about this...  6. Toro Roll - came with green onion inside. I honestly couldn't taste the toro that much, so I was a little disappointed by it...but it wasn't bad...  7. Green Tea Ice Cream with Red Bean - Japanese red bean. That's the way to go, especially in combination with this richly flavored green tea ice cream. Great combination!  All in all, the food was good. The total price came out to $30/person ($120 total), which is lower what most reviewers have said they paid, but still on the high end for dinner for me (granted, I understand this is sushi and sushi is generally more expensive).  The service, actually, was fantastic! I'm sad that I didn't catch our server's name, but I think our receipt said that she was "Server #23"...if that helps anything...hahah. She gave us fantastic recommendations, was super friendly, and checked in on us to make sure we like what she recommended.  I would come back to this restaurant, but probably only for a nicer occasion so I feel more justified in spending this money.  

                A traditional Japanese restaurant, the food was delicious and also offered the traditional food that typically serve in Japan.  I had the hot pot chef special which was derived from Miso, and that was delicious.  Overall, the food and service was good, but i do see they are lacking of waitress as some of the people including us were waiting to checkout and pay the bill, but waiting for the waitress to come and pick up the credit card.  

                Came here for dinner with friends on a Friday night. We had made reservations and didn't have to wait too long to be seated. Place was packed, which boded well. We had the dragon rolls, assorted sushi, sashimi, and sake all of which were superb. The service was efficient and polite. Will definitely be going back.  

                Their prices and portions are rather reasonable for a good quality Japanese restaurant.   The chicken karaage (essentially chicken nuggets) was enjoyable, but what I would recommend is getting the potato croquettes with this dish. The potato comes with this tangy/sweet sauce which goes PERFECTLY with the fried chicken. I also recommend their teriyaki sauce (w/ chicken, etc.)  The green tea cheesecake was unique and tasty. Their portion size for this is quite small, so don't expect to pull a Cheesecake factory and share with 4 people.   Only complaint: The kitchen closes at 9PM, even on Friday.  

                At this price range, this is probably the best option in Southbay.  For those purists who prefer nigiri over rolls, Akane definitely offers a good bang for the buck in terms of quality and variety.  Nigiri is very traditional, prepared hokkaido style, and complete with garnishes and sears where applicable.  Since moving to the southbay, this will likely become my go-to spot to get my fix.  Sit at the bar; you'll have a clear view of the daily specials.  I would highly recommend the hotate, amaebi, uni, and any of the seasonal varieties on the specials board.    PROTIP:  Even if you are just stopping in for sushi, the Chawan-Mushi here is absolutely surreal.  At five bucks a pop, it is a worthy venture if you are feeling adventurous.  

                We sat at sushi bar and ordered Omakase. We ordered a bottle of sake as well. Overall we tried about 9 different types of fishes served nigiri style, scallop, ebi plus their fried heads  and 2 types of uni (Santa Barbara and japan) plus miso soup. Overall I would like more variety and not just nigiri styles. My favorites were the uni ( of course) and the fried ebi heads. Sushi chef was not friendly and responsive to questions. They looked pretty serious actually. I would have like it better if they educate us more on the dishes eg where the fish came from and what's special about it.  

                Expensive and small portions. Slow service although the restaurant was not crowded. Asked for hot tea and they even forgot to bring it.  

                I tried chef's nabe, sashimi, uni sushi and eel role. Thr vest was eel role!!!! Very tender and tasty.  

                It's pricey, but then again it's Los Altos.  They have really good quality chicken, so I love the chicken teriyaki donburi.  I tried the oyakodonburi (wanted more veggies than the two pieces of pickled daikon) but I would pass on it.  Can't go wrong with egg and rice, right?  Well let's just say this wasn't very good.  It didn't seem to be the same tasty chicken, and overall it was quite bland.    The ambiance is also pretty nice; they recently remodeled so now it's traditional with a fancy modern touch.  

                Our family and friends have been coming to this place forever. Our experience today was disappointing.  We went in for lunch. The waitress who sat us and the waiter who brought us the tea, both seemed like they didn't have time to answer our questions. Even when taking our order, there was a sense of reluctance. Maybe it's a language barrier (they seemed to speak decent English), but a universal smile wouldn't hurt. Food is overpriced as usual. Ambiance is terrible with a giant glare from the windows and doors. Some food is above average; other items are not so good.  Overall, a two-star "Meh. I've experienced better." experience. Honestly, we've been going here for so long, we'll probably be back. But come on. A friendlier staff would definitely help us come back more often.  

                This restaurant serves the best sushi in the entire South Bay Area, period. If you are a discerning sushi lover, this is the best place to go.   Reference points:  In the City, Ino. On the Peninsula, Sushi Sam's.  In the South Bay, Akane easily surpasses Yuki or Tomi.  

                I dine at this restaurant about once a month.  The service is terrible.  We had to ask to be waited on, ask to have a cocktail order taken, flag them down to order dinner and never once did SHE come back to check on us.  Again we had to flag her down for a 2nd Beer.  She was too pre-occupied chatting with another diner she obviously knew.  Definitely not the level of service at most Japanese dining spots.  

                Decent well-priced Japanese restaurant. Service is ok (goes with the price range) and quality is not bad (nothing to rave about neither). Overall, it's a good stop for families who live close by to spend a night out, but I see a lot of dates every time I go there and I wonder how can people choose this place for a first/second date!  Not complaining, not cheering, happy it's conveniently located next to bro's house.  

                This place is dagnam pricey.   Someone recommended this place as their "go-to" sushi place so I had to try it. But man, everything was super expensive and the freshness was comparable to Tomi. All of their orders are a la carte and pretty dinky and not mind blowingly fresh. The only thing I really enjoyed was the tuna tartare appetizer b/c it had a unique flavor.   Sorry Akane, for the price and freshness, Tomi is still my go-to.  

                Akane is one of my favorite sushi spots ever!!  The food is incomparable and always incredible.  A real treat!!  

                Orgasmic tombo tataki, slightly oversauced nigiri pieces, and almost overly friendly customers (that's right, customers....)  I definitely just got offered a free sushi piece here by an older customer sitting next to me at the counter....super nice and appreciated! but slightly awkward...but I digress.  All you have to know here is the tombo tataki. This should be your mandatory item for any visit here. The combination of the slightly bitter kaiware sprouts, sweet/salty ponzu, and velvety tombo (white tuna) was a perfect dish and just melts in your mouth. Be warned the full order is huge and easily enough for 2 people.  My buddy and I also had the kinmeidai (golden eye snapper) and toro (fatty tuna) nigiri. With both of these nigiri pieces, it was obvious the fish was fresh and they gave a generous cut, but both were slightly oversauced with which left a puddle in the plate. Something that can be dividing is they put a dab of wasabi on top and not in between the fish and rice like most places. This can be good in that you know how much wasabi is in it so you don't have any "holy shit that's a lot of wasabi" surprises, but that also means the wasabi hits the top of your mouth when eating and not your tongue, so it dilutes the effect of it. For wasabi lovers like myself that's a negative but for more sensitive people that could be perfect so personal preference.  Overall, I really liked the place and it's definitely one of those places you go for simpler, high quality sushi and nigiri.  

                their rice portion for nigiri is smaller than other places which made the fish flavor stands out more! Very fresh fish. The rice for our 2nd batch of our nigiri is a bit dry though. sashimi salad is also very very good. fried soft shell crab is not oily, very tasty.  Overall, I like it a lot. The only downside is that there's a long line of wait. better make a reservation before you go  

                Food Verdict: Good but not exceptional. Service Verdict: Average service.  They brought me my food, took away my plates and brought me my check.  Went there for lunch today.  I got there at 11:40 to beat the lunch rush and to get parking.  Parking is a pain cuz they have only about 4 spots reserved for the restaurant and the rest of the public lot fills up fast.  I ordered the lunch bento ($12.95) that had tempura and tuna sashimi.  The tempura had a nice batter and was fried crispy but it lacked salt.  The tuna sashimi was fresh.  The miso soup and salad were average tasting.  The portion was rather small so I ordered a Dragon Roll ($13.95).  The Dragon Roll was good (nice crispy shrimp tempura topped with avocado and unagi).  The unagi was a little bit on the blander side (not a saucy as some other places).  If I'm in the area and am craving Japanese, I wouldn't hesitate to go back.  However, I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.  

                My company orders lunch from Akane once a week through <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FWaiter.com&s=105071b3b9e86403f37d637487af35442a205657261aec64329aa2b06ee848db" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Waiter.com</a>.  I will admit, it's a little pricier, but the fish is fresh, and I've never really heard any complaints from anyone in the office.  I usually either get...  Chirashi: Assorted sashimi over rice.  Good variety, but I wish they included ikura.  I believe my order usually comes with three pieces of maguro, one sake, one hamachi, one aburi bincyo, one tai wrapped around micro greens (so good), two tako, several strands of ika, and two tamago.  Akane Roll II: Spicy tombo and avocado topped with tempura flakes.  Pretty basic, but I prefer that over saucy, over-the-top rolls, as you can taste the individual ingredients more.  I like to add my own Sriracha to spice it up.  Beef Tataki: I love rare beef, and I love this dish.  However, the portion can be a little inconsistent.  Sometimes they give me a lot, and sometimes they don't.  Nameko Miso Soup:  It's basically miso soup with miniature mushrooms.  I love the little mushrooms.  They're almost kind of slimy in texture, so don't get this if that might throw you off.  Today, I had my coworker's extra Spicy Hamachi hand roll, and it was perfect.  I appreciate restaurants that stuff the entire hand roll with ingredients, down to the very tip, rather than load it up with rice.  I do wish they had a little more variety in their lunch menu (there's not even a seaweed salad...), but nevertheless, Akane has delivered pretty satisfying lunches to my company for a while now.  

                The food was pretty good. I wasn't blown away but at the same time the meal was fine. The prices were also not bad.  I really liked their deep fried potato appetizer. It was fried to perfection and very delicious.  Sushi was fine. Nothing memorable but good enough.  

                My favorite sushi place in Los Altos!   Consistently great service, beautifully cut and fresh sashimi, nice ambiance and delicious Japanese food.  Not the place to come looking for really exotic rolls - but they have great sashimi and bento boxes!   I love the bean sprouts they serve when you sit down, the warm towels, and hot tea.   Definitely a solid Japanese restaurant with regular clientele !  

                It's been a long time since I have been here. At least 5 years. Since Sushi Masa and Kitsho have changed owners. Looking for a good sushi place. Akane is one of my new tops, though that atmosphere is a little stiff.  

                Came here for lunch and it was pretty decent sushi for the south bay.  The salmon was a bit stringy and the yellowtail lacked flavor, but the amaebi and the ikura were pretty good.  We also had two rolls (dragon & rainbow), tonkatsu and the nabeyaki udon and they were all pretty solid.  Service was slow where you really have to wave them down to get any attention even though the restaurant was less than half full for lunch.  So overall I would give the food 4 stars for being solid but nothing close to amazing or memorable, and then had to take away a star for service.  

                Delicious, fresh and always friendly service! Solid place for fresh sashimi and delicious rolls. My kids love their mochi icecream for dessert!  

                Pretty mediocre place for sushi. I was on the corporate dime and unwittingly ordered the Chirashi. The shari rice was not great and the fish was not super fresh. Others at my table ordered the donburi rice bowls and I think those would have been a better deal.  We were the largest table in the house but had to fight for service. Even the service at Muracci's is better and that's not saying much.  I would save your appetite for a better place. For Japanese in Los Altos, you will probably have a better time at Muracci's or Sumika.  

                One of the best sushi I've had in the Bay Area. This place doesn't give you a big block of rice in the nigiri; perfectly calculated light amount of rice in the nigiri to emphasize the "neta" (fish) so you mainly get to experience the taste of the fresh fish. Awesome. I go out of my way (drive 40 minutes from home) just to eat nigiri here. Totally worth it.  

                My employer provides lunch via the <a href="/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FWaiter.com&s=105071b3b9e86403f37d637487af35442a205657261aec64329aa2b06ee848db" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Waiter.com</a> service, and every other week Akane Japanese Restaurant is featured as an in-office dining option.  Today I thought I would give them a try, and ordered the Seafood Salad, which was described as a combination of tombo, crab and shrimp over green salad with house dressing.  My experience was somewhat mixed.  While the salad was delicious, it consisted of three slices of seared tombo, one cooked and butterflied shrimp, and salad greens.  No evidence of crab.  The price for this lunch item was $15.  Given that this was essentially an iceberg salad with four pieces of seafood, the price is not justifiable.  

                We weren't impressed with the food.  I had the tonkatsu and found it to be absolutely flavorless.  Same with the croquettes.  Husband had the chirashi and felt it was a little better than average, but no match for Kitsho during its heyday.  Prices are average for Japanese restaurants.  Service was fine. Not worth the drive from San Jose.  We won't be back.  

                Sit at sushi bar, you get your food faster but your bill will take forever. I really enjoyed the seaweed salad, spicy tuna roll, and ebi ten roll but the Cali rolls were ok, I've had better.  I would definitely return.  

                This place as really good salmon and beef teriyaki... (sort of wish they gave out a bigger portion...). The beef teriyaki is a slice of beef cooked medium rare with teriyaki sauce poured on top of it, as well as the salmon. Problem is.. they are SUPER SMALL portion sizes..   I've been here twice, both times ordering the bento boxes... but the first time I went here, I got a really bad stomach ache from the tempura. I don't know why-- but I did. LOL. So, the second time around, I just decided to get beef and salmon teriyaki. I'm a little weirded out by the potato salad served with the bento box.. I've actually never had potato salad in a Japanese restaurant before... did they just run out of ideas on what to put in there?   Waitress was a little odd. My friends and I asked to get a group picture but she said she was too busy to take a picture and to ask someone else. I guess 2.5 seconds of her time to push a button was too difficult to do.  I have yet to try the sushi... who knows, maybe it'll bump it up a star.  

                Loved the sashimi plate and shabu shabu - simplest preparation and presentation, highest-quality ingredients - the essence of great food.  

                The 1-3 star reviews are bogus.  This is a full-menu, high quality Japanese restaurant.  You can't get better Japanese food for the price in my experience in the Bay Area.  We went there tonight.  Had Kusshi oysters and vegetable tempura to start, which were both outstanding.  Also tried an order of tempura shishito peppers, which were great.  I had a negihama roll, an ebiten hand roll, and  a california roll, all of which were excellent.  My wife had a tuna-avocado roll and a salad.  Even the side order of rice was way better than average.  We have been here many time, including  with Japanese exchange students who loved the food, scarfed it down, and stated it was very authentic.  I am reluctant to even try another Japanese restaurant--it's that good.   Don't believe the haters reviews, try it for yourself--you will go back again and again.  

                Francis get's 5 stars for her hard work, alone!  But the food get's an equally fantastic 5 stars!  

                Quite expensive, sushi are fresh but rice ball should be better. Green tea ice cream is the best one I have ever tasted in America. But the hot tea is $2.5, I can't believe it! This is the only Japanese restaurant I went that need pay for the hot tea!
