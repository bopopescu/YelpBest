                One word: inconsistent. I've had the pleasure of dining at King Valley a handful of times. My relatives live in Pinole so we end up there for dim sum or dinner every so often. Eating at KV is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're going to get. Depends if the head chef is cooking or not. I have had pretty good seafood dinners there and some not so stellar meals. Dim sum can be decent or subpar.   I would have been inclined to give a higher rating but last week I went with friends and relatives for dim sum and the food was not good. We even asked if they got a new dim sum chef and the waitress said yes. Thanks, won't be coming back for a while! Â The daikon cake had so little daikon and was all just flour. The steamed dumplings had super thick wrappings.....too doughy. Also same with the rice noodle wraps and the beef inside was incredibly fatty. Too much starch overall and not enough filling for most of the dishes.
