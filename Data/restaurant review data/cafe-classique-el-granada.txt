                Great spot with solid food.  Favorite is the veggie scramble, be sure to ask for fresh salsa.  Jim and Karen are the owners and they make you feel like Norm from Cheers when you come in.  Our favorite staff member is Brenda :) and she makes us feel like Super Norm. Husband loves the breakfast wrap.  Top notch baked goods made fresh daily on site.
