                You HAVE to get here before it's not here anymore. I hope the owners live forever, but....   It's got to have been here since the 40s. Maybe 50s. It's an ancient store. I can imagine the stories those walls could tell. The place has character!  For cold stuff (sandwiches, general groceries, etc), hit up the front of the store. For hot food, head to the back. Further back still, there's additional seating with vintage decor and all.   Depending on the line (meaning, if there is ANYone in front of you), you'll have to wait. Breathe deep...it's OK. The wait is worth it.   Staff are friendly without being cloying. They're very interested in getting down to business.  If you use a credit card, be aware that this may slow things up further, as they either employ a dial up modem, or else have to actually call to authorize the transaction: I was not going to let my food get cold to find out. They told me to sit, and they'd bring my receipt to me.   That said: meatballs in sauce, on a plate, with a side salad. That's all I need. Heaven on a little paper plate.   I wish places like this could get frozen in time forever. God bless the mom and pop shop.
