                I ordered to go over the phone. Friendly and welcoming customer service on phone and at time of pick up. The food was Amazing!! I ordered a combo kabob plate and the meat was well marinated, cooked and TENDER! So flavorful! The rice was simple but so fluffy, light and it had an extra flavor in it that made the most simplest rice even better. Besides the meat being flavorful, the sauce that it came with was superb! It was like a cilantro vinaigrette that you can simple eat with almost anything! I almost want to just buy the sauce too for things I can make at home. I will definitely be back!
