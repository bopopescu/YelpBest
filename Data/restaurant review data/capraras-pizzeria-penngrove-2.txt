                Fresh pastas are outstanding!  You get huge portions.  Although it's good enough to scarf down in one sitting,  I try to exhibit restraint & make two meals out it.  The salads are excellent--very fresh. I recommend the housemade balsamic vinagrette.   I'm not sure if they still have ribs on the menu, but Caprara's ribs are better than those served at  BBQ restaurants.   Pizzas are good . All the ingredients are fresh, but too much raw garlic.  We don't order pizza anymore, it's too expensive.
