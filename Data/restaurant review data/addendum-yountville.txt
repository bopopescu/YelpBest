                We walked to the rear of Ad Hoc to get to the pleasantly, and befittingly, fall-themed Addendum to the small portable and the menu was pretty simple; you either get the fried chicken or the ribs with pulled pork.  As there was the inseparable duo that is us, we decided to order one of each and share, or at least attempt to.  As the orderer of the ribs and pulled pork I began shoveling down some bbq'd goodness (all of the food appears to actually be cooked within the kitchen of Ad Hoc).  The rib meat literally came off the bone with ease and left it completely bare; it was also really good!  The pulled pork was moist and very flavorful as well.  The fried chicken had excellently crisp skin with a hint of herbiness and flavorful meat.  The cornbread, which accompanied both of our eco-friendly packed box lunches, was dubbed by us as corncake because of it's sweetness and fluffiness.  The sides of mac salad and potatoes were forgettable, but we were already pretty full on the mains anyway.    This is the place you want to be for lunch in Napa on a Thurs, Fri, or Sat on a beautiful, warm, and sunny autumn day!
