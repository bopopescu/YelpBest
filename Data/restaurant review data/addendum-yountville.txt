                Ordered online thinking that would be the way to get fast service.....WRONG!!!! Once I got there there were two lines, one dedicated to online orders only. Thought Great! WRONG!!! It took over a half hour in line. The whole time my order along with everyone else's was sitting there getting cold. Im not really sure why they cannot just hand the order to the online customers as they walk up and present their name and number. The food is ALREADY BAGGED!!!! Bottom line good food but getting it and it being warm is another problem. They REALLY need a new way to distribute orders the one they have is not working. The guy in front of me actually saw his order bagged and he still could not get it. Had to wait 10 more minutes.  

                Glad I tried addendum, wouldn't go back.  We had the Fried Chicken and the Reuben sandwich.  The Reuben was very sweet.  Not an above average Reuben.    The chicken was good - nice crunch.  It was a wing, part of a breast and a thigh.  Where's the drumstick?  That's my favorite part of fried chicken.  The chicken was under cooked.    Potato salad and cole slaw were thrown away tasted, but uneaten.    If you need to try it, try it.  It's like going to Medieval Times.  A much better idea than experience.  Way too much good food in the area to suffer any kind of mediocrity.  Spend the extra money and lunch at Bouchon!    And when you are in Southern California, Mrs. Knott's Friend Chicken is SO MUCH better than this.  And the sides are delicious.  

                Great fried chicken from the back shack behind Ad Hoc. I like it and you should try it.  

                Fried chicken, potato salad and cole slaw.   We were so excited to finally try these, but were thoroughly disappointed with them. They were merely OK.   Sitting outside to eat in the shade on a warm day was really nice though.  

                An embarrassment to the Thomas Keller brand, Addendum appeared to have a bit of a meltdown on Saturday 9/14: The fried chicken arrived 1 hour 20 minutes after ordering online (the online receipt said to expect the food in 20 minutes). It was dripping wet in oil (not crispy), and still raw next to the bone. This was not a fluke, as an entire table next to us complained of raw chicken. It seemed clear that the kitchen was told to crank out the chicken as fast as possible, ignoring quality (or food safety!). To add insult to injury, they had run out of many side dishes, leaving us with much less quantity and variety of food than advertised.  The worst part of the experience was that staff would not acknowledge that they had done anything wrong, which is ludicrous. No apology, no refund, not even a nod or wink. I can understand that they may have been overwhelmed with a crowd on a warm Saturday afternoon. However, an acknowledgement by the staff that "we f*(&ed up, and here's a gift certificate for next time" would have gone a long way...  

                Great picnic area and they bring out your hot food to your picnic table.  Picnic service too!  The fried chicken is one of the best I've had.  It's the most moist fried chicken I've ever had.  The chicken was full of juice and very tender.  I can tell that the chicken is high quality (probably organic). The crust of the fried chicken was crunchy and thick but I thought it lacked flavor.  It's very mild flavored.   The sides were okay.  I thought their beans were too heavily flavored with spices.  It was very hard to eat because the spices were cloying to my palate.  The potato salad was very simple and fresh but I wish they would add some salt and pepper.  My favorite side was the corn bread.  It was like a springy sweet corn cake.  I would come back just for the corn "cake."  I'm planning to make this a regular place for fried chicken in the summer but I hope there won't be too many tourists.  It was pretty busy on a Friday afternoon and they only offer this lunch on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.  

                Good food. Quick easy service. The fried chicken is way better than the pulled pork and ribs in my opinion. Great to grab and go.  

                My bf and I were rushing from wine tasting to tasting, so we ended up using my iPhone and ordered food through their website!  It was very easy, paid with my credit card through my phone. We ended up getting one BBQ and one Fried chicken (came out to roughly $36).  We ordered at 1:20pm, and it was ready by 1:35pm, just in time to eat it!  All the food comes in take out boxes, and actually our food was delicious. I loved my fried chicken, even though it was only 3 pieces. I loved my cole slaw too. It looked really bland and kind of cafeteria like, but I was pretty impressed with the flavor. Potato salad was decent, along with cornbread.  As we were sitting down, we saw an employee continually bring out packaged fried chicken, so they make it fresh!  (we were wondering if it was cooked in their back studio, or just sitting there all day. It isn't -- it's straight from their kitchen and walked over the parking lot!)  Ad hoc also provides wet naps for easy clean up!  Picnic tables in their backyard next to their vegetable garden makes your lunch very enjoyable.   Although I had a great time, I just wish it was cheaper. It didn't seem worth it for 3 pieces of chicken for $16.50.  

                2 stars equals "Meh. I've experienced better".....and that just about sums it up. I have definitely experienced better chicken, waaaaaay better BBQ, and far better service.  The fried chicken is cooked very well. It is very crispy and fried to a golden perfection.  But the seasoning is nothing special, the rosemary really is distracting, and the chicken itself is gamey(?)....gamey istn the right word but it had a weird taste.  The BBQ came to us cold. COLD! and was completely tasteless. It was slow cooked to tender perfection as well. But again, it doesnt matter how good you are at cooking....if you cant season it right, then whats the point???  Side dishes are whatevers, cornbread is whatever.    Worst part about the experience is waiting 2 hours!!!!!!  About an hour to order your food and an hour for it to be served to you.  The whole operation is just a hot mess.  I....you stand in line for an hour waiting to order.  Then you walk around hunting for a place to sit. Then you stock your prey hoping that someone will get up so you can snatch that park bench before someone else.  And then with the communal seating, you end up sitting next to a horde of loud Asian people that cant stop making the same joke over and over every 10 minutes to the waiter....."who are you looking for?  Joe?  Im Joe....ill take that order from you"....."Im Mary, thats my order"....."Ill be Glen, ill take that food"......  And you have to listen to that for another hour until their food actually arrives.....  seriously, go to popeyes....the chicken is way better. Love that chicken at popeyes...  

                I've had great experiences at Thomas Keller's restaurants in the past so I was very excited to check out addendum while we were in town this weekend.  I pre-ordered Fried Chicken and a Lobster Roll online and made my way to the pickup window at the time I was assigned. The gal working the counter said our order wasn't quite ready yet but that it would be ready in 5 minutes. So, we waited. And, waited. After about a half hour, we went back to the window. She said they were backed up but that it would be out soon. Finally, after an hour of waiting, we had to leave. Super disappointing. It was crowded so maybe we should have known, but I figured that a restaurant knows its limits and they'd stop accepting orders if they were over loaded.   Unfortunately, it also seemed like there may have been some shady business going on as I noticed one guy with a pickup time MUCH later than mine speak with an employee and then receive an order shortly after.  Not cool, addendum. Not cool.  

                This place has the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life. The stereotype may be that certain races love fried chicken, but the truth is that whoever ends up eating at Addendum will love mother f'ing fried chicken. Everything about the chicken is perfect. The skin is perfectly fried and salted with a perfect golden color. The inside is juicer than a tight ass in lululemons. I honestly thought there was minimal difference between Popeyes/KFC and a high end fried chicken place until I went to Addendum.  After eating at Addendum, I realized that Popeyes and KFC fry the feeble, poorly-fed and socially outcast chickens that none of the other chickens want to mate with from crime-ridden farms, while Addendum fries the strongest, best-looking and most popular chickens that the other chickens want to have sex with from luxurious farms. If you like fried chicken, Addendum is a must go as it changed my whole perspective on fried chicken, popeyes the cartoon and colonel mother f'ing sanders.  

                Overrated. I know what other reviews say but don't believe the hype. I'm no connoisseur but fried chkn was better than KFC but not some of the best ever. BBQ ribs were meh: Kinda rough, not juicy, nor anywhere close to falling of the bone. Sides were bland & uninspired. Disappointing dining experience.  

                We make the drive from San Jose a couple of times a year to eat fried chicken. Crispy, herb scented skin gives way to super moist meat. You never know what pieces you'll get-you take your chances. I'm not a fan of the cornbread-it's oddly oily and spongy, which isn't a substitute for moist. This was our first time trying the cole slaw (love the tangy dressing!) and macaroni salad (not memorable but an improvement over the potato salad).  

                I've read the recipe and excerpt for Ad Hoc's buttermilk fried chicken and drooled over the pictures in the cookbook. I love fried chicken and became a fan of TK after eating at Bouchon in Las Vegas and in Yountville (although I had a very mediocre meal and experience for dinner at Ad Hoc).  It was impossible for my husband and me to make it up to Ad Hoc on the right Monday to have the fried chicken, so I was delighted to hear that Addendum would offer us the opportunity on a time and day we'd both be free.   We arrived at 11am right as they opened. The lady taking our order was not friendly, which normally I wouldn't mention- but I guess I just expected a TK establishment to have impeccable service whether it'd be a fancy sit-down restaurant or not. We ordered the fried chicken, the BBQ ribs, and a carafe of wine. The lady filled a small plastic cup with wine and I was going to tell her that we ordered a carafe and not a single glass until I noticed that this WAS the carafe because she gave us 2 same-sized empty cups with it. $21. Wow. At this point, I didn't care because all I wanted was my fried chicken. We found a seat and a different girl who had the same cold demeanour brought out our food within 5 minutes.   The fried chicken came in 3 small, tiny pieces. I bit into it and got all batter and barely any actual chicken meat. I normally love the fatty crispy skin of fried chicken, but this buttermilk batter had zero taste and was SO greasy. The oil from the batter slid through my fingers. I couldn't believe it. I thought I got a bad piece so instead of finishing it, I tried the 2nd piece. And then the 3rd piece. All so terrible that I couldn't bring myself to eat anymore of it. I had a sinking feeling that the sides were going to be a joke and I was right. The cole slaw was the most boring I've had in my life. The potato salad seemed as if no effort was put into making it. It consisted of a few baby potatoes cut in half and rolled in mayo. I don't even want to talk about the BBQ ribs!  I've been in awe of Thomas Keller and own most of his beautiful, inspiring cookbooks. He stresses so much about the quality of ingredients that you use in perfecting your food and the love, heart, and thought that you also need to put into it to make it wonderful. I can't tell you how disappointed I was with my experience and am surprised at all the positive reviews. I am rethinking about trying to get a reservation at French Laundry for our wedding anniversary. Very disappointed.  

                We preordered online to receive our food at 1:25. We arrived early, at 1:00 and then didn't get our food until after 2:00. We tried the Philly cheese steak, fried chicken, and the ribs. All of these meals were supposed to come with three sides: potato salad, coleslaw, and corn bread. The fried chicken was the only redeeming thing about this meal, but I thought they relied too heavily on salt to make it taste good. I prefer Summer Kitchen's fried chicken in Berkeley because they don't take shortcuts and I never feel sick after eating their fried chicken. The cheesesteak came on a pretzel roll, which was a creative touch, but didn't add much to it for me. It came with some very rare beef that were sliced nice and thin, which I like. The cheese on the sandwich was melty, but cold by the time we got our meal and I didn't eat really any of the cheesesteak for this reason. The ribs were alright, but I've definitely had better ribs at many other places (B-Side BBQ, Bounty Hunter, etc).   Also, we strangely received 6 sides of potato salad and no honey corn bread, despite the descriptions stating the meals included corn bread. I brought this up with a person working there and she did give us some coleslaw in addition to the coleslaw we already received. Needless to say, we had a lot of sides and ended up giving some of them away to people we were sharing a table with because they hadn't received their food yet. Anyway, it wasn't worth it to me to come on a weekend. Maybe I'd revisit on a weekday, but in Yountville there are so many other interesting places to eat that I'd have to really be in the mood.  

                It's all about the fried chicken.  My small group decided to get the boxed fried chicken lunches on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. We placed the order online and got an email confirmation that our 4 boxes would be ready in 20 minutes. The timing didn't work so well for us because we were still finishing a wine tour, but we couldn't reach anyone by phone to push the pickup time. So we ended up with lukewarm chicken about an hour later.  Despite the delay, the chicken was fantastic. 3 perfectly crispy buttermilk pieces were melt-in-your mouth delicious. The sides weren't so great - our cornbread was slightly bitter, and the potatoes and the coleslaw needed some seasoning. But we bought a bottle of T.Keller's specially made Blue Apron Ale and enjoyed the sunshine in the green gardens.  Definitely get the fried chicken.  

                Patience should be the name of this restaurant, because you better have a lot of it if your willing to wait 2+ hours for a little tad better version of KFC chicken at 3x the cost.  I was really looking forward to trying out their famous chicken, and heard of their long lines ahead of time, but this was beyond reasonable. I waited in line for 45 mins just to order, and then was told it would be ready in 25 mins. 1 hour and 15 mins later, I started to see people that order behind me, get there orders. I complained and got my order 10 mins later, only it was the wrong order and not only that but the chicken was raw.  This is ridiculous at that point I just wanted to leave. If your already late, at least cook your food right, so your customers don't get samonila.  A party in front of me waited a hour plus and got their entire order $250+ all raw chicken. They offered us refunds, which was the right thing to do. But at that point the damage is irreversible.  I understand its a busy weekend, but you have to address your customers with realistic expectations, stop accepting orders if you can't handle your current ones. Don't tell them it will be ready in 5-20 mins when you know it's an hour I would of understood. Please make sure you cook you food right, it's more expensive to hire a lawyer when you get sued for serving raw chicken.  I love Napa, and being a foodie but I don't think I'll ever be eating at ad hoc or addendum again.  

                Fried chicken was great. Lobster roll pretty good too. Great picnic spot but I gave it four stars because the wait is far too long  

                Delish! About $20 but worth it. The sides do no live up to the fried chicken. I wish they had mashed potatoes or corn instead of slaw. Potato salad was also just ok.  

                Addendum is worth a visit. The fried chicken is very good as were the lobster rolls that were on the menu during our visit over Labor Day weekend. The scenery is beautiful with communal picnic tables in a backyard setting. This was a great way to start our Napa Visit.  

                Went here for the first time last weekend. The weather was great and perfect for eating outdoors. I didn't know that this place was the outdoor or take out part of Ad Hoc.  I had the fried chicken and tried their BBQ.  The chicken was unbelievable! I loved the crispiness of it and it was cooked perfectly. So juicy and tender all the way through. The cornbread was on point as well!   The BBQ was okay. Would have liked a little bit more sauce, but it wasn't horrible.  I'd come back here for the chicken alone! The line was a bit long but it was worth it.  

                Their 3-piece fried chicken wasn't as good this time.  The chicken was warm and I always prefer the steaming hot chicken (i.e. warm makes me a little nervous but at least I didn't see pink as well).  The outside wasn't crispy and lacked flavor a bit.  

                The dining area was very nice and well maintained with picnic like settings. Our food, the fried chicken and ribs, arrived Luke warm? Chicken was ok ribs had a little kick. I would NOT come back to Addendum again.  

                Hi, my name is Taffany and I'm a fried chicken addict.  Going to Addendum has changed my addiction into an obsession--a quest for the perfect fried chicken. And it's a futile quest because Addendum has gotten the whole thing down to perfection.  When I'm at Addendum, there was nothing else that mattered. It was just me, the crispy, sinfully delicious fried chicken. Side dishes, yeah they're nice but like I said, I've only gotten my eyes on one and only one thing.   Fried chicken!  

                My Visit: A few minutes before 11am on a Saturday / Labor Day Weekend  The cashier window wasn't even open yet and the line at the shack was already quite lengthy. It was a chilly morning but by the time we got to the window to order, the fog burned off and the sun started to come through. Also, almost all of the picnic tables were taken but they are communal so don't be shy to ask if any empty seats are taken. You could always sit on the planter box ledges, or in your car too.   We ordered the famous fried chicken and the labor day special, the lobster roll. We brought our own drinks but you can purchase some at the cashier as well as dessert too. I saw bags of cookies and another lady eating a sorbet I believe. The cashier noted our order would be a 20 minute wait. To my surprise, I thought the food was cooked in the Addendum shack but it actually comes from Ad Hoc and fellows come from the restaurant and weave their way through the crowds, calling out names to get the food to you.   After the wait, we got our food and boy was I eager to open the boxes holding the prized possessions. Each box is labeled with a sticker indicating what is inside. We got one "fried chicken" box but instead of the "lobster roll" box, we were given a box with the bbq label. Boo. This was a bit disappointing considering the wait just to get the food but my bf went back up to the cashier and she apologized, letting us keep the bbq (score!) while phoning in to get us a lobster roll. We waited another loooong 8 minutes or so before we got the lobster roll to complete our order. My impression:  - Fried Chicken: Moist and extremely juicy with a tasty batter. You could really taste that the chicken was brined which really made for such juicy chicken. I thought the batter could have been crunchier and I suppose it would have been if the chicken wasn't sitting in a box for more than a few minutes.   - Lobster Roll: A very different lobster roll. The roll wasn't served traditionally (lobster with just mayo or butter) but actually included a pickled kind of relish with pickled red onions. The pickled flavors played off of the richness of the lobster meat but I prefer a more "naked' or traditional roll with just the simple rich flavor of the lobster meat.   - BBQ: A bit of a let down but hey, it was free. The flavor profile tasted like beef jerky seasoning and there just wasn't enough fat on the ribs. They were too lean and didn't taste moist or tender enough.   - Corn Succotash, Potato Salad & Cornbread: All were simple, yet delicious. I'm sure you can get your kids to eat this stuff. I liked that the potatoes were kept whole, and the cornbread was on the sweeter side and tasted like dessert.   I think we left Addendum around 12:15ish and it truly felt like we spent such a long time there but I guess that's just part of the Addendum experience. Also, in case you were wondering, there is only one bathroom for everybody so there's a wait there too. Overall, I feel like I paid a lot of money to do a lot of waiting at Addendum. I'll stick to making reservations at Ad Hoc for their fried chicken mondays.  

                We went in July 2013 and sat at the outdoor picnic tables.  They make the best fried chicken I've ever had, bar none.  The skin is amazingly crispy and the chicken is juicy and flavorful.  They can make a gluten-free version, too, that tastes equally as good. 1000% sure to come back next time we are up here.  Great setting in the back parking lot to the Ad Hoc restaurant.  Conveniently across the street from the Villagio.  

                Disappointed... I heard so much about this place and was so excited to try it out that I kept on chanting 'fried chicken' the whole morning. We arrived early Saturday morning around 11am, when they first opened I think. The line was not long and our wait time was maybe only 10 minutes. We of course got the fried chicken, which costed $17!!!!! For only three pieces. The chicken itself was not very special. Moist - yes, seasoned - yes but not extremely well, crispy - yes. But NOT spectacular and not worth the $17 (plus our time and efforts to get there...). The sides consisted of corn bread, which was very moist and good, but TINY. We also got the potato salad and coleslaw as sides, none of which impressed us. The portions were very small and they tasted like they came from Safeway. Actually, I take that back, I think Safeway probably does those better.  We won't be back to Addendum for sure. Prior to visiting Addendum, we were contemplating booking a special dinner at Ad Hoc. Not sure about that anymore...  

                My friend is on a mission for finding the best fried chicken. So when we were in Napa this was a must stop for her.  I love that they had an app to order ahead from and the whole farm theme.  Everyone in our group ordered the chicken. And we got the ribs dish so everyone can sample. I would say do not order the ribs. It was dry and not very flavorful. The chicken was OK  in my opinion it was over cooked. The potato salad was good but the slaw was severely lacking. Also the corn bread was a disappointment.  

                At $16.50 a head for lunch, this is probably the best deal you're gonna get at a Thomas Keller establishment. It's a small price to pay for someone like me who cannot afford The French Laundry (yet!), & I must say it's worth every penny.   We arrive around 10:50am on a Sat morning & were the first in line! Addendum is located behind Ad Hoc in a little garden with picnic tables. It's really casual & quite cozy, perfect for a quick weekend lunch before heading to the wineries. They only offer 2 things on their menu as far as lunch goes, the Buttermilk Fried Chicken box, or the BBQ Ribs & Pulled Pork box, so we got one of each. They come with some corn bread & 2 sides. You order at a little shack & they bring the food out to you once it's been prepared inside Ad Hoc.   Our boxes came out nice & hot, they smelled so amazing I could not wait to sink my teeth into that chicken. Once I opened up the box, I quickly take a bite & get a mouthful of perfectly fried chicken skin followed by juicy, tender meat. HEAVEN!! Now, I can't remember the last time I've eaten fried chicken, probably years ago, because I was never really a fan. But if all fried chicken tasted this good, I'm pretty sure I'd be mondo obese because I'd be stuffing these suckers into my belly every day! The ribs were tasty as well, perfectly cooked & came clean off the bone. I loved the light sauce & almost crispy surface, very sophisticated ribs if you asked me. The sides were ok, nothing to write home about. Although, the corn bread was pretty good, but it's moist & syrupy, almost like a dessert rather than a side dish.  The ambience in the garden is pretty nice as well, making for a very nice lunch. And by 11:30am, the place is poppin' & I can see people lickin' their fingers at every single table. That's when you know a place is good, right?  

                Thomas Keller's cooking without the $$$$ pricetag.  You can't really complain about that.    My friends and I were starving after our wine tour/tasting and we needed some really hearty food.  We wanted something quick and tasty.  So Addendum really hit the spot.  For $16.50 you can get fried chicken or barbecue.  The barbecue was pulled pork and ribs.  The portion was fair and it also came with a side of cornbread, potatoes, and coleslaw.  It was delicious and was at our table in less than five minutes.    Notes: -Plenty of picnic table seating.   -It's packed up nicely if you want to take your food to go.  

                pssst...hey you, over here. Do you want Ad Hoc fried chicken without the hassle of making a reservation weeks in advance and making the long drive from SF on a Monday night? Get yee to Addendum!   For $16.50 you get three pieces of fried poultry perfection and two sides. You order from a small shack in the Ad Hoc garden and within minutes your lunch is brought out to be enjoyed at one of the many picnic tables. The chicken was as great as always but the sides were pretty disappointing. Sweet corn succotash was fine but the potato salad was runny and lifeless.  No matter, the star of this show is the chicken and well worth the price of admission. They also featured a bbq plate which I might have to give a shot if I can ever force myself to not get the chicken.  

                There are so many good restaurants to choose from in Napa that we had to break down our daily eats for the 2.5 days we had in Napa. Not being able to fit in Ad Hoc, I was so glad to be able to try Addendum.  This is easily the best fried chicken I have ever had. The crispness is seriously unreal. We had a wine tasting to rush to and even finished eating some of it after our tasting- 2 hours later and it was still crispy and juicy. The chicken is just pure deliciousness.   Also tried the lobster roll. You could tell all the ingredients were great quality ingredients but I personally need more of a kick to my food. The pickled veggies on top were a great touch for texture but a pinch of spice or sriracha mayo could have helped.   My only complaint and reason why I give this 4 stars is because of the wait. Knowing we had a tasting to go to we asked how long the wait for the food was going to be. Was told 20-25 minutes which we thought was fair for cooked to order chicken. We waited over an hour for our food. One hour and 8 minutes to be exact. This place is definitely worth a visit, just be prepared to wait.  

                A year ago, we decided to go to addendum on labor day. We got there late and waited and waited but luckily we were able to get one of the last Fried Chicken meals.   This year, we learned from our mistake last year and went 15 mins before they opened. It was perfect.  Fried Chicken and Lobster Rolls. Between my wife and I, we got 3 meals and finished it all. The lobster rolls might sound pricey but for the size of it was much larger than most lobsters rolls I've had.  Their crispy buttermilk skin on the chicken is sooo good. I tried replicating it unsuccessfully.  Now if they would only open an Addendum in LA!  

                Because i do not plan on eating at French Laundry in the near future, i made sure to bookmark Addendum! Hidden behind Ad Hoc, this garden houses a handful of wooden benched tables to enjoy their infamous fried chicken and bbq. It's much more decently priced and the chicken is so moist. I loved the corn succotash and potato salad. The corn was refreshing and i'll even have to attempt to make a similar dish at home i loved it so much! The potato salad is solid as well - red potatoes and string beans to give it some heartiness.  Props for the cute and clever name, Addendum.  

                Great lunch option in Napa. You may end up spending a couple dollars more than a basic sandwich and chips, but if you order ahead you can pick up your food promptly at your selected wine, either eat in their garden area, or take your food to your next wine tasting destination. The fried chicken is amazing. It is a bit of a salt bomb, but easily the best fried chicken I've ever had. I cannot say the same for the BBQ, which is pulled pork and ribs. They were OK, but there is much better BBQ in the Napa Valley. The sides are good- not too remarkable but go nicely with the chicken. Feel free to treat the corn bread as dessert because it is a sweet and buttery slice of heaven.   This is my new go-to lunch option while up in Napa.  

                Great cozy picnic spot (especially on a nice sunny day), get your $16 box of fried chicken or pulled pork & ribs with sides and sit on a bench or the grass to eat. I got the fried chicken and hate to say it, despite all the reviews here, I thought it was just okay. The batter is sweet, which is what I think makes it popular. So if you like that, should definitely try this. The cornbread was super delicious!   Beware of the wasps though, they have a number of the wasp catchers around, but they still took over my food at the end.  

                Labor Day weekend camping ended with a stop at Addendum! yelp said it was closed but it wasn't. Got their Labor Day weekend special "Lobster Roll." Easily the best lobster roll I have had. The lobster shines through ( unlike other places where all you taste is bread mayo and celery) the sweet onion is a great compliment and the brioche bread was not overwhelming.   Also had the fried chicken which was great but not awesome. Love the buttermilk flavor. Had watermelon wheat beer. The corn bread which was more like a cake was amaze balls! Till next year!  

                Checked this place out for some "fast food" and found it to be good.  I wouldn't go crazy for the fried chicken, but it was nice to be outdoors and munching on some delish treats.  They make the food pretty quick since there only have a selection of two meals - you either get the BBQ or the friend chicken with some side dishes of potatoes, greens, and corn.    The outdoor experience is what made this place so nice.  This is a place for groups that want to spend a low key day in the sun.  It might not be as fun if it were cold, but during the weekend I went, it was perfect.  I was surprised it wasn't super busy - but seats may get limited by the peak hours of lunch.  

                16$ for three pieces of chicken and some sides!!! WTF I can get a huge bucket from Colonel Sanders for that?!  OhHhHh...but soooo worth the price. Best chicken I've ever had!  

                Ok I'll be honest, I cannot justify taking off on a Monday just to sample Ad Hoc's famous fried chicken. Well... I can justify it... but I really shouldn't.  Luckily for me Addendum serves it on Saturday from their go-to booth. Huzzah huzzah huzzah! We called a bit ahead and showed up just in time for our order to be ready. We each got 3 pieces of chicken, potato salad, collard greens, cornbread and a drink.   We sat outside on the picnic benches and it was a cool day, so we opted for sitting in the sun. As usual, I devoured my whole meal and all pieces of the chicken were incredibly moist including the white meat. The chicken was perfectly fried, the batter was light and crispy without being too thick in areas. It was seriously tasty, although I think it was rosemary that was a little stronger for my taste, as I often like the pure chicken and batter taste with my fried chicken. Nevertheless, I am now a believer. It was truly delicious.
