                Best-kept secret in town!!  If you want amazing sandwiches of all types, come here!  Privately-owned, you'd think twice about pulling into the public parking lot area of an RV Park.  But once you leave the deli, you'll remember to stop by and load up on lunches here for your local nature trips, be it hiking, camping, or just a day at the beach.  Anyone working local will be addicted.  Being almost vegan, I go for the Marco Eggplant sandwich on a herb roll.  Best for take-outs!
