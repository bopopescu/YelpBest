                I ate there maybe 3 times decades ago. The first two times the meals were excellent. Then I brought my family to celebrate my mother's birthday. They hostess was exceptionally rude. The waitress was rude. It spoiled the evening. I wrote to the owner who phoned me, apologized, & said he'd send me a complimentary meal certificate. He didn't. I reminded him twice & then gave up. I never returned.  I read in the Marketplace magazine there is new ownership so I returned tonight. It is an attractive restaurant with a good view. My wife & I waited maybe 3-5 minutes for a hostess & were seated. I should mention it is a slow night. The waiter was fine.  The bread was good but not warm. I had clam chowder. For a first class restaurant it was a serious disappointment. It was what you'd expect at a cheap diner. Watered down & not many clams. I compare clam chowder to Dukes in Seattle (wow) or Splash in Pismo Beach. It wasn't close.  We both had different pastas. Both were okay but far from special.  We shared the chocolate mouse. It was good but not special. A previous reviewer said it cost $10.50. Maybe ours was different but it cost $7.50.  A previous reviewer commented on the owner seating herself with favorite customers. Absolutely. She sat & chatted with two elderly ladies in the booth next to ours 3 times while we were there. Perhaps they were friends? She ignored all other customers.  The food is well prepared but not especially exceptionally tasty. I should lower the stars just because it supposedly is a high class restaurant but did not. The chowder is a real loser. It was BLAND.
