                I have been working in Hayward since November 2013 and I'm still trying to find good places to eat. I called and ordered the War Won Ton. I must say the flavoring is perfect. This has to be one of the best War Won Ton soups I've had. I will be back.  The only downfall is that they have a $15 minimum limit to use your ATM/debit card. They did charge me an additional .40 to use it.
