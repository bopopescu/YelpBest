                I have been eating at this restaurant for 14 years ever since the owner and his cousin owned it and now the owner and his wife both great owners now have done an amazing job to the restaurant. Whether I was 18 or 32 years old the food tastes amazing and it only gets better year after year . you have got to try their Taekwondo fries and their carne asada fries, it's the best ever and the portions are huge.  If you are out in Davis and would love to try Mexican food try this place it will blow your mind. BECAUSE ITS AMAZING.  But dont just listen to me...try it for yourself.
