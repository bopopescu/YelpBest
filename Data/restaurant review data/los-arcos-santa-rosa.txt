                We were really excited to try this place after seeing the rave reviews, and especially seeing their focus on fresh, healthy options on the menu, and we really wanted to like it. Alas, it was just okay. Not a ton of flavor, even with the salsas, which weren't very spicy and lacked any kind of zing. There was nothing we tasted on any of our plates that excited our taste buds at all. Friendly waitstaff, quick service, at least an attempt at having healthy options, good prices and generous servings... so definitely an all right place if you just want some quick, though unremarkable Mexican food. But if you're looking for something really flavorful, I would look elsewhere... like Mi Pueblo.
