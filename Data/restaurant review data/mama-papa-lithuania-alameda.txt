                I've been wanting to try this restaurant out for a while and I'm so glad I did. My husband I ended up coming here because the restaurant we were going to was closed for a private event.  What a nice surprise - Mama Papa Lithuania has great food and a knowledgeable owner who loves to explain to you the food and culture of Lithuania.  Award-winning Pilsner was nice and light for a summer evening. We started with a bowl of borscht with mushrooms.  Different than the Russian versions I had before, it was lighter, tangier and very refreshing.  For the main course, husband ordered potato dumplings stuffed with meat and mushroom sauce, and I had the stuffed cabbage.  The stuffed cabbage was light and fluffy, not heavy at all.  I enjoyed the sauce around it and scooped it up with a spoon to eat with the stuffed cabbage.  Loved the potatoes, garlic and pickles served with it.  My husband's dumplings were a bit saltier that what I liked, but he really liked them.  For after dinner, we had a piece of honey cake to share - it was just the perfect size, not too sweet, and nice flavor.  I had a very nice herb tea - brier hips, oregano and chamomile.  I insisted that my husband try the amber tea, and he seemed to enjoy it.  Overall an awesome dinner, and would definitely be back to try other dishes.  If I could, I'd give them 4 and half stars :)
