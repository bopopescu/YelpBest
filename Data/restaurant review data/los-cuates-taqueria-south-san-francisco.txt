                Learned about this hidden gem from my sister. All I can say about this place is that -- it's friggin' delicious and the friendliest service ever you'd be like 'what the fug?'  This place is a little hidden- just kinda remember it as that one taqueria by Smart & Final in South City lol   You walk in and are immediately acknowledged. Service is a blast, the folks here seem like they're having a great time doing their job and running the place. You get chips automatically when you order, and they've got a generous salsa bar. So far so good! I've had their chicken quesadillas- yum! I've also have had their steak enchilada plate- yum! Chips and salsa- yum!  Overall this place is a new favorite and another great place to go to for good food.
