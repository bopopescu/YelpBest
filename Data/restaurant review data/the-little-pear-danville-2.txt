                If you like ducks this is the place to go. They are too cute (just remember to not feed them bread. They're ducks).  The food was pretty decent, despite there being quite a bit too much dressing on the salads. The BLTA is definitely worth getting, it's very tasty. Their half pound burgers are pretty tasty too, and the blackhawk "mall" is an unexpectedly wonderful setting.
