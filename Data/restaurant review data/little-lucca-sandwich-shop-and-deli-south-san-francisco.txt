                Husband loved their sandwiches-however I didn't think my 30 minutes of standing in the sun and then getting cut off by a girl that ordered enough to feed the entire block was worth it....   When it was finally my turn to pay after about 47 minutes since I first stepped in line.. I put down our Â two drinks and two chips. The lady was so amazing she managed to only ring up two sandwiches.... Even though I said, "And my drinks and chips." And smiled at her then pointed down at it. I paid... and then she says, "oops sorry, I didn't ring those things up.." So she spent another 5 minutes doing that...   I think I will only come back if I really can't find another sandwich spot.
