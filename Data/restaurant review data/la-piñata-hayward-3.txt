                This is the best mexican restaurant in the Bay.  Don't be tricked by the name, as there are a few other La Piñatas in the Bay Area.  The others just aren't the same.  Everything here is good.    My fave is the #5 combo with a crispy pork taco and enchilada verde.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.
