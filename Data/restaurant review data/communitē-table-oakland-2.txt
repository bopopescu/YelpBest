                I found out about Communite Table through our neighborhood network group and, boy,  I'm glad I did!   I've ordered a number of the soups and chicken pot pie (several times).     Each  offering is well made and delicious - and Michele's pie crust is superb.   I'm planning to order a selection for Thanksgiving to bring to friends house - what could be easier?  (and I'm all about keeping things easy)  I just popped a pint of the White Bean Minestrone soup in my bag for lunch  - healthy, tasty - and again, easy.   Ordering is streamlined and Michele is professional and gracious.  All the dishes are so well made and each container is clearly marked for anyone with dietary restrictions.   Lots of options including vegetarian and vegan.   Michele's menu rotates with the seasons so keeps it interesting.   Be sure to check out Communite Table or stop by the next popup at Café 3016.
