                Oh, man! I loved it so much! I loved it!  This is a little place, but I feel the staff does an amazing job of being personal and accommodating. In fact, I somehow booked the wrong reservation time, and when I called same-day and realized my mistake, they fixed it and reassured me all was well! (It was :) )  My husband and I became total snobs after the dinner we had. We didn't know how we would go back to regular, every day food. We've had French food before (usually on anniversaries), but we just felt this place took it to the next level. The way we wordlessly expressed our amazement with our eyes as we silently savored the biteful of food we had in our mouth was enough to prove we'd never be able to settle for less again (at least for the evening. Than we went to China town and dove into some really grubbin' buns and it was ok).   This was my first experience with foie gras, and it was executed quite well - the filet mignon was delicious, and I would recommend it.  However, the best thing I ate that night was likely the beef cheeks. I can't wrap my head around the way they blended beets, goat cheese, and some veggies into this beautiful, balanced sauce that cradled the beef cheeks so elegantly. When I took my first bite, I exclaimed "why would anyone eat anything other than beef cheeks when beef cheeks exist?!?!" I meant it.  When myself or my Mother make a roast, I always cut off the fatty pieces. Yes, they're tender, but ew - that texture! No. I can't. My Mom loves it - my hubby doesn't mind it, either, to get that delicious fat flavor.   But this, somehow, was the best of both. It was so soft that I just touched it with the side of my knife and it slide to the bottom of the plate with a little-too-loud clank. It was so much softer than any cut of beef, but didn't have the gumminess that I hate of actual fat. It didn't have an entirely fatty flavor - it was somewhere inbetween.   I mean, I would eat the cheeks of any animals at this point if I were assured they would taste this good.  This place is Aces. I can't say enough, but I should, so I'll stop.  

                Outstanding value for what you get. Food quality: A+. The atmosphere is casual, yet chic - dim lights, simple French decor.   We came early on a Saturday night - 5:30pm - so it was not crowded (which was nice). Started to fill up closer to 6:15pm.   What we ordered:   -Mussels with curry/cream sauce. Wow! Absolutely delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and rich. The mussels were large and perfectly cooked.  -Little gem salad: A little gem this was! The blue cheese is not as "smelly" or "pungent" as most others. I really enjoyed it. The bacon brittle is highly addicting.  -Beef cheeks. The beef literally melted in my mouth...holy cow! The beet puree on the plate was to die for and had a creamy texture. Mushrooms perfectly done. I could have done without the potatoes...but still not complaining because the rest of the plate was amazing.  -Lobster risotto with scallops: YUM! The portion looked small, but I could not finish it, because it was so rich (trust me though, I wanted to).   Dessert looked good...but couldn't do it. Way too full.   Thanks for a fantastic experience.  

                This is a restaurant that I keep thinking how great the food tasted even days later. To the top! Even when they were out of the Malbec half, they had a Bordeaux ($30) which was just has pleasurable and actually a better pairing for my absolutely delicious duck. And my 'o my, the wine sauce that came with my duck, and the infused (campaign?) black cherries! And I'm always a fan of spinach, oh so fresh. My companion's steak was equally memorable. You know it's good when you love the charred fat. Yumbuckets! This came with the best as they can get, string green beans. I was in heaven, wait, I till am. I felt like I revisited my ancestors, my father the hunter and my cousins the farmers. It was magic that delighted all our senses.  I can talk about my chocolate covered pear dessert, but I would just be repeating myself, but ooh the sprig of mink was perfection.  The service was great. So great that many of the other patrons knew the staff. There is a definite neighborhood feel among the patrons as well.   Our group was celebrating Valentine's Day a day before and so took the only reservation left. at 5:30pm. Bistro Central Parc has inside AND outside sidewalk seating which on this night was packed. This a is bistro restaurant of the greatest proportions.  

                What we ordered: Duck confit salad Mussels Trio salmon  tartare Foie gras torchon  Beef cheeks  Lobster risotto with scallops   Him: hands down one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Tucked away in panhandle, this restaurant is one of the best kept secret in SF.  Her: Must get beef cheeks. Skip the foie gras torchon. Everything else is good, just up to preference.  

                The Bf and I have tried this place for brunch several times now and have not been disappointed.  Each time we've ordered their mussels and fries and they are delicious! The fries are cooked to perfection and the sauce for the mussels is fantastic! The serving (at least on the last occasion) is a bit small though   On the last outing I tried their eggs Benedict and I can't complain, I thought it was pretty good but nothing spectacular. What I loved most was the side salad that came with it. The dressing they put on it is amazing. So glad I ditched the side potatoes and got more salad.  The bf got the scallops and risotto with lobster sauce. SO YUMMY! I'm typically pretty good about trying a bite of his food and then leaving the rest for him... With this dish I kept trying to sneak a bite (he was kind enough to pretend not to notice). It was delish, will have to go and order my own  

                This place has been on my bookmark for so long, finally came for a leisure Saturday late lunch!   We ordered scallop risotto, croquet Madame   Et ratatouille. Scallops were perfectly seared, creamy risotto served with lobster saw totally blend the flavors all together!   Madame sandwich is flawless! Cheese top and buttery toast give every bite a hint of sweetness.  Ratatouille, okay have to say as a big fan of this humble french peasant yet homey dish, this is the best I have ever had so far! Flavors were really infused into the vegetables, yet veggies didn't completely loose the texture! Great balance of sweetness, sourness and savory.   Service, a really friendly and considerate lady prepared our table, when she said Bon appétit,I know she really mean it and she has confidence in her food!!!!!  As I replied on the receipt " will come back!"  

                Bistro Central Parc is a great date spot, tucked away in NOPA. I like that it's off by itself, right in a neighborhood, not really near other restaurants. It adds to an already quaint and quiet atmosphere that the restaurant provides. Service was spectacular. Very friendly and attentive. The (new) owner stopped by our table to check on our experience and that's always appreciated. And the food was excellent. Not the best $100+ (for 2) I've ever had but everything was prepared perfectly and had excellent flavors. I could stand for the portions to be a little bit larger but hardly anything to be unhappy with.  

                Everything we tried was so delicious. Service was amazing - our server even bought a round of our drinks because the entrees took awhile! Best food Ive gotten in SF for such a reasonable price. Scallops and bone marrow are a must!  

                A truly enjoyable experience was had tonight. The reception was pleasant, the service - excellent, the food - robust in taste, and the prices - reasonable.  Our lineup goes as follows:  Appetizers: - Mushroom risotto (small form like rice-cake size; tasty, but leaves you wanting more) - Baked brie (with tomatoes and slices of toasted bread; like bruschetta with brie)  Entrées: - Seabass (light and tasty over au gratin cauliflower) - Cow cheek (like tender hamburger with a slightly different flavor)  Dessert: - Almond tart (like an almond version of pecan pie) - Chocolate mouse (over a pastry shell with strawberry slices; creamy, light and airy)  The maître d' and servers were French and were friendly and personable people. It added much to the evening. We would easily return.  

                The food was good, but I wouldn't come back here. The dining area was empty except for 3-4 tables. We asked to be seated at a table, but were told all of those tables were reserved, and could either sit at the bar or outside. It was a cold and windy morning, so outside wasn't an option for us. I understand that those tables were reserved for 1130, most for noon or later, but we would've been done by noon if not earlier. Like I said, I understand, but it sucks to sit at a cramped bar, surrounded by an empty dining area.   I had the French onion soup, which was good. Absinthe makes my fave onion soup, but this was a close second. I also had baked Brie, tomato concasse, and roasted garlic with toasted baguette. The roasted garlic was buttery and crispy all at the same time.  It took at least 15 minutes to get our check because the two waitresses were busy. It seemed like once they got busy, they needed more staff than they had. Annoying, after sitting at a cramped bar for our breakfast.  I wouldn't eat here again. I'm sticking to Absinthe.  

                Mais oui, c'est bon!   Happy Bastille Day, mes amis. Not so coincidentally, visited Bistro Central Parc over the weekend for a 5-star French meal worth Yelping about.   Reservations are encouraged, but not required. Our group of 6 called ahead. Lucky for us, a true Frenchman was in the group and able to parlez his way into an 8:30 pm seating. Who needs OpenTable when you've got someone who speaks the owner's native tongue? When in doubt, there's generally seating at the bar as well.  We were given a warm "bonsoir" upon arrival and it was quite amusing to watch our friend schmooze with the owner en Fracais, making decisions about wine and appetizers to get started. We had a lovely Beaujolais as well as a bottle of vino that I swear smelled like asparagus in a bottle.   To start, go with the baked Brie and garlic. Everyone at the table must eat a little bit, 'cause that's the rule when eating whole garlic cloves. Sure you leave smelling like a vampire murderer, but it's a group effort.   It's not every day that I have the pleasure of enjoying a nice cut of meat. So anytime I see steak frites on the menu, it's all over. Bistro Central Parc's version is parfait! Hot fries, medium rare meat. If you can convince the person sitting next to you to order the mussels and share, do it. Dip those frites into the buttery white wine sauce and try not to think of all the calories you're consuming.   By this time, I'd consumed a few glasses of red wine, steak, fries, garlic, mussels, not to mention the dinner rolls and butter. Though there's normally room reserved for dessert, it just wasn't happening. However, when I come back again, will set the bread aside in anticipation of a sweet treat finale.   Overall, Bistro Central Parc a pleasant surprise tucked away in NoPa. Had it not been for friends who lived nearby, would never have been. I can't speak for its authenticity, but my French friend loved it. And that's good enough for moi.  

                Love the intimate, cute, romantic setting.  Lobster risotto was amazing. It was perfectly cooked. Perfectly seared scallops and perfectly flavored lobster sauce. Drools. 6/5. I thought my filet mignon with foie gras was just ok. The foie gras was great but the steak was mediocre masked by sauce. 3/5 unfortunately.  Creme brûlée was on par.  4/5  

                We were prompt for our reservation. I love the relaxed atmosphere. i believe it was either a $30-20 corkage fee so watch out. The escargot was delish. The Rack of lamb was so juicy. I never had foie gras so I wasnt a fan. My date loved it. You have to try their dessert menu. I reccommend the tart  dark chocolate cake. The place is pretty tiny but still can be intimate. I would reccomend this place for anyone craving some french cuisine. I wish they had a website.  Our waiter was casually dressed in a polo which I didn't expect. The service is quick.  

                Service is great but food is okay. The dessert was pretty interesting. I had the strawberry with the strawberry purée and vanilla ice cream and there's black pepper underneath. It's really interesting when you mix everything together.  The grilled scallop risotto with lobster sauce is pretty good, but a bit heavy (too cheesy). The beef tartar is not bad. MUST try the duck confit salad; very good and tender. The seafood cioppino is okay; too watery.  

                Overall, my first (and probably last) experience was disappointing.  Not in a major catastrophe kind of way but just falling significantly short of expectations from the rave reviews.   We arrived around 11:15am for brunch and the place was barely half full with almost two dozen seats empty inside.  We were told politely they were all taken/reserved and had to sit at the bar or outside (where it was freezing cold, no thank you).  So we sat elbow to elbow at the bar while most of those two dozen seats remained empty until we left.  Understand the policy but it was pretty lame and it's why most places don't do reservations for brunch; most parties show up late anyway and it leaves couples like us fending at the bar watching a mostly empty dining room.  Food was ok overall but nothing epic.  French onion soup was the standout, one of the best I've had in the city and almost as good as Absinthe's.  My Eggs Benedict was just ok; tasted pretty average just like everything was assembled together as expected and the English muffin was way too doughy and underdone.  My wife's Brie with toast was decent.  People were nice but the two girls were overwhelmed at the end and we were stranded waiting for our check for almost 15 minutes.    I suppose if you're in the neighborhood, this isn't a terrible bistro but if we are gonna to venture out, we'd rather just go to Absinthe or Bisou which are a lot better.  

                I've been here for both brunch and dinner and it is in my top 5 fav in the city!  Love love this place!  The filet mignon with foie gras and scallops is a MUST, you will not be disappointed!  

                Food and service were great.   I would recommend the Filet Mignon with Foie Gra it was really tender and tasty.  The duck breast wasn't bad but wasn't it wasn't special enough in my opinion.  

                Visited this cute place with some co-workers. I loved the ambiance: casual, non-stuffy, relaxing atmosphere! Food wise: the duck breast was so savory (fav dish!!), the filet mignon with foie grass (also delish), and the mussels filled us up! All in all, I really enjoyed this place.  

                Another French bistro for the books! If you are like me, and love charming, intimate places that serve delicious and beautifully presented food without breaking the bank - then say "Oui, Oui!" and give Bistro Central Parc a visit.   I did a very extensive research for a dinner spot for NYE dinner. I wanted to find a spot that did not offer a tasting menu just for the sake of it, and wasn't hard to make a reservation to. To my luck, I found BCP and it was the PERFECT choice.  Appetizers: _____________  Escargot -  A little disappointed it wasn't served in the shell. To me, its more moist this way. It The parsley to butter and garlic ratio wasn't well balanced. There was way too much parley. Will skip this app. next time.   Salade D'endives Au Roquefort -  Endive salad with pears, apples walnuts. Refreshing, light and tasty.   Moules Au Curry Madras -  Plump and perfectly cooked. There was a subtle hint of curry in the cream base sauce. I thought it could use a little more garlic.  Entree's _______________  Magret De Canard (Duck Breast) -  Our entire party was in awe of the presentation of this dish when it came it the table. It was ordered rare too and was rich, slightly tangy/sweet, and savory at the same time. The side of potatoes and chard was perfect with it.  Carr D'agneau, Ratatouille (Rack of Lamb and Ratatouille)  The rack of lamb was a perfect medium rare. There was a great crust of seasoning on it and it was so moist. I'm glad my bestie gave me a rib to clean off. nom nom nom.  Risotto Aux Coquilles St Jacques -  Scallops atop a risotto in lobster sauce. This dish underwhelming and kind of bland. The scallops were tiny and the risotto was flavorless. Yelpers were not right with their high recommendation of this one.   Overall, a wonderful meal and I'll definitely be back now that the foie gras is back in California !!! :D  

                Amazing upscale French cuisine . The delicious starter, entree, and such charming and friendly  ambience made our night one of a kind! The foods were beautifully presented and the dessert was unique and heart warming! The Bistro Central Parc is with no doubt a 5 star and a must go restaurant in the city!  

                Wow! What a great place!  I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical at first when I saw that this restaurant was serving upscale french cuisine at moderately low prices. Especially eating here on New Years Eve, I was expecting an overpriced menu just for the occasion.   However, unlike most upscale french restaurants that serve exquisite food at high prices, Bistro Central Parc remains humble and offers exceptional french cuisine at a reasonable price. With four of us dining here that evening, we got the opportunity to try a lot that their menu offered..  Appetizers: Escargot - very typical "french" appetizer to order and nothing too special. A little too much parsley was added to it and overwhelmed the flavor of the snails.  Salade D'endives Au Roquefort - endive salad with pears, apples walnuts. Very well presented and very light.   Moules Au Curry Madras - Mussels! Always a good choice and they were very satisfying. The curry and cream added a nice spice and flavor to the mussels.   Entree's: Magret De Canard (Duck) - Both presentation and taste were absolutely exquisite. Tie between this dish and rack of lamb for the best entrees of the night.  Carr D'agneau, Ratatouille - Rack of Lamb and Ratatouille. I am always a fan of ratatouille as a side, but this time it was a bit overcooked, yet still very tasty. The rack of Lamb was spectacularly delicious and presented very well.   Risotto Aux Coquilles St Jacques - Scallops atop a risotto in lobster sauce. This dish was somewhat disappointing. I was expecting the scallops to be seared better and the risotto was nothing extraordinary.   Overall, I highly recommend trying to place out. For the price, its definitely worth it and I plan to visit again soon to try some of their other dishes out.  

                I find my judgement and opinion of Bistro Central Parc all over the place. Some parts of my dining experience, I enjoyed; some other parts, I did not care for. The ups and downs ultimately make me feel like BCP is mediocre, thus I gave it 3/5 stars. Rough explanations to follow.  Convenience of the restaurant? Poor.  I'm told that reservations must be made a month in advance for prime dinner hours, elsewise eat rather early or rather late? I understand that great restaurants are known to have backed up reservations, but I did not find myself wowed by the food. This is why I feel like the reservation hassle for BCP was not worth it. The restaurant is also located uniquely in a neighborhood of homes, yet parking proved difficult. I know that SF has terrible parking availability in general, but to drive up and down those blocks of residential homes at 5pm to find a spot should not have been that hard... I don't think so?   Food? Great, good, & kinda sucked... depending on the dish.  When I went, my table of two ordered three items: American Kobe Style beef tartare - The great dish. I loved it. Delicate, aromatic, delicious.  Risotto aux coquilles St Jacques - The good/okay dish. That's just it. Was good, but no more. House special of the night ribeye steak - The dish that kinda sucked. This dish was ordered by my partner for the evening. It was him who said it first, but I agree that it tasted like... a chain-diner quality steak. It was so below average and bland. Rib eye is my favorite cut, too. What a shame.  Service? ________ (Haha, no comment.) All of the servers are attentive and nice... enough. It's just, I couldn't buy their accents or personas. My opinion of the authenticity of their french characters may be irrelevant, which is why I'm choosing to leave it out. Let's just say that my experience at BCP did not share any similarities to the restaurants I had enjoyed during my time in Paris.   Bistro Central Parc, in all, was just blazé to me... french accents and all.  

                Nothing fancy, but it was good. Fresh and very french food.  

                Sadly typical of SF to spawn yet another ersatz "bistro" with French pretensions but with no real "cuisine" worth the trip.   Please at least stop serving that ghastly gristly confit which hardly saw earth, let alone has ever been laid to rest as it should until the meat falls off the bone, and I don't mean after being gnawed at for half an hour. And those lentils are only fit for composting.   SO very sick and tired of all these pretentious, unpalatable, costly wastes of time and taste...get your greedy heads out of your overfed derrieres and make it worth our while you cynical pretenders!  We can only pray that Buvette opens a bistro in SF.  

                A cafeteria style find a table experience. Sandwiches, bakery and bread, indoor and outdoor tables. The bread bowl chowder is popular and filling (if you eat the bowl as well) but I preferSan Francisco chowder. Take home a loaf of sourdough.  

                I brought my husband here for his 45th birthday. The food was excellent (we shared a tartare appetizer and I had the duck entree and my husband had the steak). We shared a lovely bottle of cabernet. We were too full to order dessert, but they still brought out a tasty profiterole with a candle in it, as the whole room sang happy birthday, once the lights were lowered (this must be a tradition, as the whole restaurant joined in). The service was impeccable. We'll definitely be back.  

                I came here for the first time while on a study break with my friend. They provide excellent customer service. Everyone from the servers, chef, and owner were very friendly. It felt like we were visiting the home of close friends for a dinner party.  The food tasted wonderful. We had the french onion soup, brie chaud, salade D'endives au roquefort, filet mignon, salmon, and apple tart. Definitely recommend the french onion soup, brie chaud, filet mignon, and apple tart.  We arrived at the restaurant pretty late but were welcomed and not rush throughout our meal. They even played awesome 80s music towards the end.  Wonderful first time french dining experience!  

                Amazing!! From the service, quality of food, decor, I loved everything about Bistro Central Parc!! It's definitely a great place for a birthday dinner, because they sure made my birthday special.  Here's my story:  I love scallops, heard about this place from friends, and saw that it was 4.5 stars on yelp. So when my friend said he'll treat me out for my birthday, I suggested here.   Prices are reasonable for the qualify of food you get.  Appetizers around $10, dishes around $22-27. My birthday is in December, so they had nice Christmas decorations on the ceiling that gave it a wonderful holiday atmosphere.   ** FOOD **  KOBE BEEF TARTARE - (5/5) - "raw beef with a raw egg on top?? Alan, are you trying to kill me on my birthday??"  "Fine, do you want me to try it first?"  "Yes please :)"  He said he was really good, and I thought to myself, hey this place got 4.5 stars.  It CAN'T kill me. .....And it didn't. In fact, it was AMAZING that we ate it until the plate was wiped clean.  The server even gave us extra baked bread for the beef tartare, on the house! I love when restaurants aren't stingy about that, and it was a good start and pleasant surprise for the night.  SCALLOP RISOTTO W/ LOBSTER SAUCE - (4.5/5) - this was delicious, and I loved how generous they were, giving 5 huge scallops for only $22! AND it was fantastic!! It was an interesting combo for scallops with the risotto and lobster sauce, the taste was rich and flavorful, but I would not eat the risotto by itself.  I always eat scallops whenever there is an option and though it still doesn't beat my favorite at Le Bernardin in NYC, these were still great and I was pleasantly pleased with this dish.    My friend had the rack of lamb, which I had a bite, and we both agreed it was the best lamb we've ever had.  Again, great flavor.   ** BIRTHDAY STORY **   After we finished our food, my friend said he had to go to the bathroom, in which he secretly told the servers it was my birthday.  He came back where we talked for a bit, and all of a sudden, the lights of the whole restaurant went out.  Confused, I turned around and the servers held a plate with dessert and a candle and started singing happy birthday, along with everyone else in the restaurant!! I was so surprised!! After they finished singing, everyone clapped, turned the lights back on, and gave us 2 free glasses of dessert wine!  The host talked to me, shook my hand to wish me a happy birthday, and then gave me a Bistro Central Parc cup as a birthday gift! Omg, this restaurant goes above and beyond to make your birthday special!! The dessert was a delicious cream puff topped with almonds and it was fantastic.  This restaurant was fantastic, everything about it!   Thank you Bistro Central Parc and Alan C for a delicious and special 25th birthday! :)  

                Awesome, just awesome.  Where in the city can you find reasonable prices for main courses?  Alongside, they were really busy, our waiter hustling around, forgot our drinks.  Realizing, he hurried to get it without a problem.  On top of that, he was very friendly, gave us all his recommendations (including what he didn't like).  The food came super fast and hot and delicious.  Be warned with the copious amount of butter!  Risotto, steak, and the mussels were excellent.  Creme brulee was very typical, but reasonable for the price, and the special dessert beignets were awesome.  As the waiter left the check, he comped us the drinks and didn't even tell us (or maybe he forgot).  That's professionalism (or luck!)  Definitely will be coming back.  

                Reeeaally great food! The muscles alone are worth the trip! We had the French onion soup, which was very good also, the bouillabaisse, fillet minion, and creme brulee! Great service and atmosphere.  

                One of the best restaurants I been to! Not only is the food hella good but the service is absolutely the best!   1.) We made reservations at 730 and was running late, didn't get there until 8 and they were still cool with it.  2.) the owner let us use his parking garage space bc we couldn't find parking 3.) free bday gift for my friend 4.) did a nice bday surprise for all the bday ppl in the restaurant 5.) help us take hella photos(until we finally got the one we are satisfied with) 6.) food was amazing  7.) everyone was super friendly and funny  8.) guided and helped my friend out with the parking(he went outside in the cold haha)   Made a yelp account just to leave a review and this is my very first review bc they deserve it! (:   Everything was just too perfect. Hope I didn't leave anything out! But will definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone!  

                I have lived next to the restaurant for over a year and finally took the time to have a meal at their establishment.  It was one of the best meals I have had in the city.   Bistro Central Parc was such an overall pleasant experience. The owner was very gracious and hospitable. He made us feel like honored guests dining in his own home. We sat at the bar and had a great conversation with one of the attending regulars.  My fiance and I shared all 4 dishes and one glass of wine. We started with the the steak tartar, followed by the mushroom risotto. We then split the chicken entree and finished off our meal with the apple tartine. All the dishes tasted great. We did not leave hungry, and we enjoyed the surrounding company and service through out the evening.  If you are looking to experience french cuisine for the first time this is a great place to try, you can easily have a delicious meal for two and keep it under $100.  

                Awesome neighborhood French Bistro! We live a few blocks away and love coming here for dinner.  Everything on the menu is amazing- my fav is the beef tartar. Service is excellent!  Outdoor enclosed patio is great for dining. And you can bring your pooch!  

                Tip I wrote after I dined here: So I've had to argue with our server thru our fatty lamb n mispriced wine. It's not a good sign when u point something out n ur server makes up excuses or keeps insisting that he's right. At least I got them to adhere to their listed wine price. N yes here's a pic of their wine list! How much is the margaux?! If u said $60 then u'd be arguing with the server too!  I just wrote a super long review that neither posted or saved so now I'm starting over which is actually adding to my dislike of this place. To sum it up, I came here to celebrate my dad's birthday. I grew up in a french restaurant and the menu here was very reminiscent of my dad's menu. I had reservations elsewhere, but since this restaurant had such great reviews I changed my reservation. I chose poorly!  The service when we got there at 6p was great. Friendly and attentive. But there were only about 2-3 other tables there so they weren't super busy at the time. The owner (I think) came by and said hello. One thing that bothered me was he picked up our bottle of wine on the opening of the bottle and complimented our selection. This to me was super unsanitary. Especially since he just walked into the restaurant! MINUS ONE STAR!  The apps were pretty good. A must order are the mussels! The were nice, juicy and not overcooked which is a pet peeve of mine. Who likes tiny shriveled rubbery mussels?! But these were just the opposite. And the sauce?! Soo good! My parents kept dipping their bread in the deliciousness!  So now comes time for our entrees and the restaurant is now packed! My dad ordered the rack of lamb which came with 2 pieces. Unfortunately half of those pieces were fat leaving my dad with only one piece of lamb. We brought this up to our server since my dad said this may be due to the fact that they are end cuts. But the server basically dismissed us saying that this was local lamb. So local lamb is fatty?! MINUS ONE STAR!  Time for dessert. I told them it was my dad's bday and we ordered the brulee. They were nice enough to turn down the lights and bring out the dessert with a candle while singing happy birthday.  In addition to dessert, I also ordered a port. I took a pic of it since I take pix of everything and saw that the glass was dirty. In the dim lighting I couldn't see anything, but thanks to my flash, the remnants of what looked like a towel were stuck to the glass. When wiping down glasses you wanna make sure you don't use one of those white kitchen towels since they leave residue on the glass. MINUS ONE STAR!  So now the nail in the coffin of this awful dining experience. The check! When we got it, it said the margaux was $80. I mentioned this to the waiter and he told us we were wrong. I told him I had a pic of the wine list on my phone and he stormed off. He came back with the wine list and said it was a misprint. Well, shouldn't a restaurant honor their listed prices?! After some arguing, he honored the listed price of $60, but not without some arm twisting. MINUS ONE STAR!  I probably would have given this place 3-4 stars if it wasn't for everything that happened. I know our server was slammed but even so you still have to remember that part of your job is customer service. I've been to a lot of restaurants, but I've never been treated with such disrespect. Even in france our waiters were nicer!  

                I finally made it out here with friends after bookmarking the place forever.  It was so good I made a reservation right there right then for mom's birthday in a week.  For both visits, food did not disappoint us at all.  Bistro Central Parc is hands down one of the best French bistro in SF.  It reminds me so much of Paris, where there are tons of bistros tucked away in the corner of a quiet residential block off the main streets.    In my opinion, good food is what gets you 4 stars, but service is what earns you the 5th star.  And they clearly deserve that here.  At mom's bday dinner, the owner came and greeted her personally.  The entire staff sang happy birthday to her.  And she even got a mug as her bday gift!  If you are looking for Michelin rated service, this won't be it.  But if you want the super friendly staff and atmosphere, you have to check this place out.  I can't wait to go back and try the other dishes on the menu!  

                Very nice hidden gem, the food is good, the truffle risotto is fantastic, everyone is super nice & hospitable. The wine is good & the prices are not outrageous. A great go-to place since we live around the block!  

                I've been here numerous times over the past three years and have never had a bad meal. The service and food are always outstanding.  

                A fellow Yelp reviewer implores us not to trash a place based on our "visit-specific details." OK, well, I'll just assume the food is this bad for everybody, then.  The steak tartare is watery, as if it were previously ... eh? Never mind. Just avoid it.  Overcooked duck blistered with a gas-grill bitterness. Hideously fishy-tasting scallops with stiff, mushy "risotto."  I think we have here another case of avoidable problems. Scallops risotto is a difficult dish to do well, as is duck breast, to order. Simple, French bistro dishes are less hard and still very appealing. Nevertheless, people demand "beautiful" food (in ring molds, table side) over basic quality. A shame.  

                There was plenty of space at the bar on a Saturday night -- score!! Our waiter was unapologetically French... sarcastic, funny, well-informed.. and was actually pretty nice about how long it took for us to decide.  Warm spinach salad special was out of this world... just perfect in every way. We had the beef tartare, which was a huge portion btw, and it was actually TOO flavorful for me if that makes any sense? Like the herbs was just a bit too much. I gave in and boyf allowed me to order a side of fries, which again there was a lot of... kinda just normal fries but done really well, perhaps in duck fat? Then we had the bouillabaisse which was beautiful. We were completely stuffed after all this, but we were enticed by the seasonal dessert -- warm strawberry compote with ice cream and this little almond tuile? SO GOOD.  Anyway, we ordered too much and could have done without the tartare I think. I was surprised how big the servings were. This place is great for really solid bistro food and a pretty casual atmosphere.  

                The croque madame (melted swiss, ham, bechamel on pain de mie, sunny side up egg) was quite good. It was in the shape of a sandwich, but it really had to be eaten with a fork and a knife. This was quite a unique dish and I loved how the swiss cheese was melted on top of the toast.  I also tried my girlfriend's omelette with ham and grilled onions. It was a bit runny from the onions, but I thought it was really well made.   After we paid the bill, our group just sat around and caught up with each other. They didn't kick us out since it didn't seem too busy, so that was a plus.
