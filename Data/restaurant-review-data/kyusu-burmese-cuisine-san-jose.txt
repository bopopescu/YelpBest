                With good friends, enjoying good food.  Tea leaf salad Lani & Chris #2  Bayar Gyaw - yellow pea tempura  Seik Tar Chet - goat stew Lani & Chris #1  Kauk Swe Thoke - Burmese style noodle  Mon Hingar - fish soup noodle Lani & Chris #3  All were delicious.  

                I was less impressed by this place than I was with Burma Superstar, but given that there are so little Burmese food restaurants here I guess it's hard to compare a true star in the show versus a newcomer. I still don't think this place is entirely bad, but it just wasn't really my thing because I thought all the food tastes more or less the same.  I really did enjoy the flat Burmese noodles dish. That was probably the most surprising of all of the dishes we ordered. Their tea leaf salad is ok at best. I would definitely wait to get it at Burma Superstar because it is way, way, way better.   The prices here are pretty good though!  

                Tea Leaf Salad. Fish Noodle Soup.  These two items were pretty on point. Not sure if our starvation played a role, but we inhaled it and it was delicious.  Shan Style Fish and Herbs. This is a tilapia marinated with herbs served in a clay pot. This dish was just okay, wasn't anything special or really good.  I'd definitely come back here if i was in the area and try some of their other items.  

                I think it's a 3.5, but I rate it 4 for its originality (as in creativity) .  Despite I have been living in south Asia for years, I never had a chance to try Burmese cuisine. I had a tea leaves salad. That was darn inventive! a unique taste of mixed nuts, spices, chilly, tea, raw cabbage...very unique. I have been trying a lot of food in my life and it was my first time to taste something like...that !  The curry noodle soup (Ohn No Kauk Swe) had a divine perfume and the coconut jelly (dessert) was so fine!  Close and similar to genuine south Asia food. I will go back to try more!  

                Good comfort food. Well done, fast, reasonably priced, and great service.   Items recommended:  Tea leaf salad with cabbage- traditional style  Fish in clay pot or country style fish- these are the top to fish items on the menu & most popular fish on the menu... Fish was cooked perfectly, it's flaky. A side of rice is served with the fish, & it goes perfectly with it.  Goat curry had great flavor, of course a bit gamy for a person who doesn't eat goat. Option of rice or prata (bread) with the entree.  You could walk in or make reservations, but it can fill up very fast so I suggest making reservations to be safe. Fyi beer & wine is served here ;-)  

                First time trying Burmese food, and am a fan! My friend summed it up really well, it's as if Thai, Chinese, and Indian food had a baby!  On a Thursday evening, it was a bit slow, and we had good service since there weren't too many customers.  We ordered the tea leaf salad to start, the chicken noodle soup with minced pork, and the chicken curry with rice.  Food came out quickly which was great since we were hungry! Tea leaf salad had an interesting taste, but it was quite yummy! Loved the addition of the peanuts and beans for the crunch. The noodle soup was really good (minus the cilantro), great flavors, only con about this dish was the noodles were way overcooked. Chicken curry was really nice too, not too spicy or strong in flavors. Just good chicken and potatoes in a nice mild curry. Would recommend ordering the rice over the prata as they complement one another.  Overall, great food for a low price.  

                Food is okay (3 stars) and service is great (4 stars). Same day reservations are taken before 5pm.  Favorite is the Shan Ngar Chet (fish in clay pot)! Seik Tar Chet (goat stew) is also tasty. Tea leaf salad is just okay, but I enjoyed the coconut jelly dessert!  

                I was surprised with this restaurant!  I had low expectations and thought it was just going to be similar to Chinese food, but I was wrong. Their menu was quite interesting and the dishes I got were very good!  I had the coconut milk noodle soup, which was very similar to Thai, but very good. I also tried the Tilapia in tomato sauce that was very tasty. For vegetables, I ordered their green been salad and although it looked plain, it had a very good taste.   Service was slow, but good. I'd recommend it for a change from Chinese food.  

                I asked my friend, "What's Burmese food?" to which she replied with something along the lines of Burmese food being like a fusion of Vietnamese and Thai food. I was totally sold by that before she even got to the Thai part.  Anyways, came here on Halloween for lunch with a couple friends and this place is pretty small and quiet inside. We were quickly greeted and seated.   I ordered the Aroma Chicken entree which comes with a cup of soup and side of rice.   While waiting for our meals, my friends got their tea leaf salad to start off with. I tried the salad and was pretty amazed by the salad. It was nice, crunchy and super fresh.   Our food finally arrived and I quickly started to dig in (well, after taking a picture, of course). The chicken was different than what I expected. It had a tangy, pungent taste to it. It wasn't bad or anything, it was pretty good but just not what I was expecting. The chicken comes fried too which made me happy (I really like fried chicken).  The menu here is pretty small but everything looks really good. Will most likely come back here with a couple of different friends so they can try this place out as well!  

                Wife brought me here for dinner. It's her usually place with coworkers. I enjoyed the food. Comfort food. Each dish has its own flavor. I highly recommend to order both rice and pita to go with the dishes. Would definitely come back to try the curry.  Place looks clean and staff is friendly.  

                Kyusu has been bookmarked for a while now.   Finally got a chance to visit last night.  We arrived early--around 5:30 and there was plenty of open space.  By the end of our meal, as we were leaving, every seat was taken and we could barely get out the door because of the crowd waiting to get in.  Definitely a popular spot.  While we were standing, waiting to be seated,  my friend and I were looking over the menu and making comments about the tea leaf salad.  A customer who happened to be standing next to us waiting for an order to go, piped in and told us that the tea leaf salad was "to die for" and she was there picking up three orders of it!  So we knew we had to try the Tea Leaf Salad.  Here's what we ordered:  VEGETABLES WITH PEANUT DIPPING SAUCE - This also came recommended by the customer we ran into at the door.  This was just OK for me--a bit skimpy on the portion.  I found the flavor and texture of the tomato/peanut sauce a bit off-putting.  I don't think peanuts and tomatoes were meant to be married.  Not a fan of this appetizer.  Wouldn't order again.  TEA LEAF SALAD - Don't expect SALAD on this one.  It's more like a nut salad if that makes sense.  But the combination of all the crunchy nuts and tea leaves with the citrus tang of the dressing was very satisfying.  I can see why the customer we met at the door ordered three of these.  Would definitely order again.  CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP W/COCONUT CREAM BROTH - If you're a fan of coconut milk-based curries or soups, you'll love this.  This really hit the spot, and you can add condiments/chili to spice it up.  The waitress squeezed some fresh lemon over the dish as she served it.  Recommend this dish.  I liked that the tables were spaced out nicely, and several booths where you have your own private, uncrowded space.  The owner (I'm assuming it was the owner) waited on us and was very sweet.  There's no hype here.  Kyusu's good reviews are not exaggerated.  Unique, good-tasting food served here!  Oh, and we shared a coconut cake, served with coconut ice-cream.  It didn't look or taste like "cake" at all.  So this dessert should be re-named.  It tastes (and looks) like rice pudding, and it's served in little diamond shaped pieces.  It tasted pretty good, but I think most people who order this are most likely going to be disappointed--not because it tastes bad--but because it won't measure up to their expectation of CAKE!  

                I was rather disappointed in this place after coming here based on all the great reviews.  For two people we got the tea leaf salad, the beef stew, and the pork stew.  The tea leaf salad was extremely salty and all I can really taste was the salt from the fermented tea leaves and unfortunately not much else. The peanuts were like nicely toasted so that tasted good but other than that I was not a fan.  The pork stew as the other reviewers said tasted like a Taiwanese dish with Napa cabbage and pork belly.  The beef was tender in a tomatoey broth. I did enjoy the paratha pancakes which were flaky and buttery. Too buttery for my friend but I like it.   The ingredients used in all the dishes were fresh and natural. The final dishes however just were not impressive.  

                Food was delicious but comes in small portions.  They dont take reservations past 715p so we had one at 700p. Good thing bc there is always a wait. You have to write your name on paper and wait to be called. We didn't know what to order but the ones we did, were delicious.  

                My fiancé and I were celebrating our anniversary and wanted to try somewhere new, so we came to Kyusu Burmese Cuisine.  This was the first time my fiancé had Burmese food and the second time for me; the first time I had Burmese was at Burma Superstar in Alameda.  We had a reservation for 7:30 PM and were promptly seated after flagging down a waiter.  Even on a Wednesday night, there was a good amount of people dining here, so I recommend making a reservation.  Although there were only 2 people waiting on the tables, I felt like we had good, polite service.  They pulled out an extra table for us since all the food we ordered would not fit on our table.  We order the original tea leaf salad, kauk swe thoke (flat noodle dish), country style fish, curry aroma chicken, and seik tar chet (goat stew).  This was too much food for just 2 people; we had enough leftovers for at least one more meal for the both of us.  The original tea leaf salad was very tasty and flavorful.  The original salad has shredded cabbage, pickled tea leaves, fried beans, fried garlic, peanuts, sesame seeds, dried shrimp, tomato, and red chili.  This was one of my favorite dishes.  We ordered way too much food for 2 people to finish in one seating, but we finished all of the tea leaf salad.  If you just eat a clump of the pickled tea leaves by themselves, it might seem salty, but the salad is great all mixed together.  I would definitely want to get this dish again the next time we dine here.  The kauk swe thoke is a flat flour noodle dish with tomato, onion, chicken, fish sauce, garlic oil, chili oil, shredded cabbage, cilantro, lemon, and roasted yellow pea powder.  I have no idea what yellow pea powder is, but that probably was the ingredient that made the dish feel exotic or different.  The flavors in general felt familiar or somewhat similar to other Asian food but a hint of something new or different.  The noodles were good to me, but the flavors were too intense to my fiancé.  The country style fish was okay.  We meant to order the shan style fish and herbs dish but got the country style fish on accident.  The fish is fried and comes in a tomato sauce with onions, garlic, tamarind, and chili.  The fish came with rice.  It was not bad but was my least favorite out of all the dishes we tried.  The curry aroma chicken was yummy.  It is kind of like fancy popcorn chicken.  The chicken has a light batter and is marinated with curry.  The fried chicken pieces come out in a plate with sweet and sour sauce, chili, cilantro and green onions.  Although the menu says that this dish comes with rice, they gave us the option of rice or prata.  I liked eating the chicken with rice since it was so flavorful.  My fiancé and I both thought that curry aroma chicken was one of our favorite dishes.  The seik tar chet is a goat stew.  This dish has the option of rice or prata.  My fiancé and I usually do not eat goat due to the gamy flavor, but this goat stew was not gamey.  It kind of reminded me of the Vietnamese dish beeft stew dish (bo kho).  The goat stew was good but would land somewhere in the middle when compared to the other dishes we tried.  The prata is like a flaky flour pancake with a buttery flavor.  The prata was good.  I could just eat the prata by itself.  The next time I would want to get the tea leaf salad, curry aroma chicken with rice, and prata again and try some more new dishes like the shan style fish and herbs and coconut milk noodle dishes.  

                Yummy!!!  My first time trying Burmese food, and it was delicious! My friend and I shared:  Crispy Tofu- You could skip this. It's basically $5 for chips... Tea Leaf Salad- This dish was so SIMPLE, but soooo tasty! We got the cabbage one, and it did not disappoint!! Nan Gyi Thoke- I think this was what we got, and it was also very yummy. It kinda reminded me of a lighter version of mee goreng!! I love mee goreng!! Seik Tar Chet (Goat Stew)- Very tender, and just melts in your moufff.   Loved my experience here, and I really want to take my parents next. So yes, I will be coming back!!  

                Thanks to Beth W's recommendation, my fiancée Santi and I came to this Burmese restaurant looking to get reacquainted with one of our favorite cuisines. It was already late in the evening, but the dim-lit interior was still bustling with a younger crowd and those wait listed by the door. Without much decor, the fragmented physicality has several breakout rooms stacked with tables and one central walkway that leads to the front door.  We ordered the Seik Tar Chet ($14) that came with goat meat, onion, garlic ginger, cumin, tomato, curry leaves, and served with prata. The goat was not too gamey, flavorful and all the spices and support ingredients were wonderfully pronounced. We used pieces of soft prata to soak up the remaining. It was delicious.  Next, we had the Shan Style Fish and Herbs ($11) that was put together with tilapia, turmeric, fermented bean powder, onion, tomato, garlic, ginger, green onion, cilantro and herbs. The boneless fish was fresh and easy to fork into, and the support ingredients were accentuated through simmering in a clay pot. I recommend it.  All the pointed flavors had us wanting to return after missing the opportunity to try the Tea Leaf Salad. Service was slightly absent, but overall friendly and efficient. I'd be very interested in returning with Santi the next time we're in the area.  

                Since we moved to San Jose, we have eaten at Kyusu a few times, and it's always good.  The servers are prompt and polite, the restaurant is clean, and the food is yummy.  The only complaint we have is that the booths are a little bit tight.  We have started almost every meal with the the tea leaf salad, which is very flavorful.  The sautéed shrimp served with lettuce also is a good start, particularly if you want to share it.  We also really enjoy the coconut milk noodle soup, which is so good.  For entrees, our favorites thus far are the goat curry, fish claypot, and pork belly stew.  For dessert, the Burmese "cake" and ice cream are wonderful, but the "cake" really is a type of pudding cut in to wedges.  So, do not expect a western style cake.  Overall, Kyusu provides very good food at reasonable prices.  So, we will keep coming back.  

                Burmese flavor explosion!  Unique food with a unique ambiance (the wooden alcoves look so exotically oriental that a properly staged photo at Kyusu could rival those bragging about fancy tropical resorts).    Of course we got the TEA LEAF SALAD, $9 (A mix of pickled Burmese Tea Leaves, fried beans, fried garlic, peanuts, premium sesame seeds and premium sesame oil, dried shrimp, fresh tomato & fresh shredded cabbage & hot red  chilli).  Phew, what a mouthful... of deliciousness.  The elaborate list of ingredients made me half-expect a mediocre hodge-podge, but it turned out to be wonderfully complex in flavor and texture: there was a memorable contrasting mixture of savory vs. plain, edgy vs. familiar, crunchy vs. minced, preserved vs. fresh, oily vs. light.    Because you must seize the chance whenever non-pad-Thai opportunities present themselves, we decided to get a delicious oily noodle and settled on the NAN GYI THOKE, $9.5 (Thick rice noodle served with onion & tomato based all natural fresh chicken, fish sauce, garlic oil, chilli oil, shredded cabbage, cilantro, lemon & roasted yellow pea powder).  As expected, it was delicious and oily.  Like the tea leaf salad, there was tremendous complexity in this dish, and it had a nice kick to it.  Hmm yellow pea powder... I didn't know such a thing existed, but I think I have found my new secret ingredient hehe.  In the wake of this complex oily deliciousness, we also got the BITTER MELON SAUTE, $7 (Bitter Melon sauteed with onion, garlic and dried shrimp), a relatively healthy dish.  I used to hate bitter melon (understandably so given its repulsive, self-deprecating name), so I wanted to see how Kyusu masters this challenging vegetable that would stump chefs at impromptu cooking competitions.  The healthiness plan was foiled because it still came out somewhat oily, but the use of spices and the dried shrimp interestingly transformed the bitterness to an earthy aroma.    The only thing about the service is that they seemed to judge me for taking photos of the food.  They mix the tea leaf salad and the noodles after bringing it to your table, so I had to ask to do it myself so that I could take a picture, and the waiter gave me a funny look.  Yes I admit to scorning t(w)eens taking obnoxious selfies everywhere, but I justify my food porn with the fact that it is artsy dSLR work.  (Plus I'm advertising for free!)  Conclusion: Great food, though on the oily side.  If you get anything that comes with mixing, be prepared to confront the waiter and stand your ground when asking for a pre-mixing pause if you want to take a picture.  

                Visits: 1st Rating: 3.5* Service: Excellent Dishes: Goat Stew; Sauteed Shrimp; Tea Leaf Salad  Good authentic Burmese cuisine that hits the spot.  ¤ Goat Stew (3.5*). Tender & somewhat flavorful goat meat. Goes great with rice. Flavors were subtle but still good. Beef is probably best. Will try beef next time.  ¤ Sauteed Shrimp (3.5*). Tender shrimp, not rubbery. They get this way due to the longer simmering time. The thick sauce is good.  ¤ Tea Leaf Salad (3.5*). Not the best one we've had but still flavorful & good. If you've never had tea leaf salad, you're missing out. Give it a try, it's definitely different. Tea leaves go great with the peanuts & other greens. Don't worry, you're not eating dry bitter tea leaves. It's full of flavor that you wouldn't expect.  

                Kyusu is a relaxed, unintimidating spot to introduce eaters to Burmese cuisine. The servers are easygoing and patient. Later, one of the servers informed us that this is a Japanese-Burmese fusion spot. Who would have thunk it?  We ordered the original tea leaf salad, country style fish, wet tar chet (pork belly), shan style noodle (no soup), sanwinmakin dessert.   The tea leaf salad and shan style noodles were my favorites of the night. I'm a big fan of tea leaf salad, in general, and carbohydrates covered in tasty sauce. The noodles looked like udon and tasted chewy and springy. Also, the pork belly, which looked and tasted like a familiar Chinese dish, tasted great.  The country style fish was strangely reminescent of Italian cuisine. Maybe it was the tomato base. To be honest, we're not big fans of cat fish. I wouldn't order this dish again.  My parents are already planning on bringing their friends back.  

                It's been a while since I've given 5 stars...but Kyusu definitely deserves it.  Maybe it's because this is my first legitly Burmese restaurant review, but I gotta say...the TEA LEAF SALAD completely took it home for me! I fell in love with the flavors, assortment of seeds, fresh ingredients, and attentive service with the live mixing of the salad in its serving presentation! If you're at Kyusu, YA GOTTA GET THE TEA LEAF SALAD. Ok, promo time over.  There aren't too many options for vegetarians (maybe 2 simply veggie orders), but if you're pescatarian, you're much luckier! We also ordered the catfish claypot because of its high recommendations, and were very satisfied with that choice. Kyusu truly spices up the food with flavors like fish oil (very prominent) and lemon...so my taste buds were awakened and totally happy after this early meal.  We also came early around 5PM because we heard that the wait time was super long--came on a Saturday night. There were some tables taken, but we were immediately seated without any wait! When you leave the restaurant, you'll be reminiscing about the delicious and savory flavors that are lingering in your mouth, and I know I'll be back if I'm looking to get a knockout punch of tastes sometime soon!  

                Word on the street is that this place trumps Burma Superstar. Let's see.   ***TEA LEAF SALAD - A mix of pickled Burmese Tea Leaves, fried beans, fried garlic, peanuts, premium sesame seeds and premium sesame oil, dried shrimp, fresh tomato & fresh shredded cabbage or fresh lettuce & hot red chili.  I know, the mandatory item when eating Burmese, but it's never particularly tickled my fancy. I mean it's pretty good, a nice assortment of seeds, leaves, & crispies representing various flavors of the rainbow. The pickled tea leaf is pleasantly potent, and the chilies have a nice aromatic kick. But overall, I haven't found it crave-worthy. It was properly executed here in my opinion. It is a fresh intro, I suppose.   ***SHAN STYLE FISH & HERBS - Fresh farmed tilapia marinated with turmeric, fermented bean powder, onion, tomato, garlic, ginger, green onion, cilantro & herbs. Served in clay pot. Comes with rice.  This was really nice. Tender boneless chunks of fish in a really light and yet somehow aromatic sauce with lemongrass as the most recognizable contributor. The rice was a plain white variety, but it fulfilled it's purpose.   ***SEIK TAR CHET (GOAT STEW) - Burmese style goat stew made with local fresh goat, onion, garlic, ginger, cumin, tomato and curry leaves. Come with rice or prata.  This "curry" was so mild and approachable that I would have believed you if you said it was an American stew. I guess there were subtle trappings of Asian origin in the spice combination, but it was really eating it with prata that brought it eastward. The prata (one of my areas of expertise) passed the test--soft, pliable, oily, & sweet.   ***SANWINMAKIN - Burmese styled baked cake use semonela, coconut milk, butter, milk, poppy seed, almond and raisin.  This reminded me of the tapioca sticky cakes with coconut shreds that you can get in East Malaysia, but with more goodies & seeds. Very simple & pleasant. The accompanying ice cream was your Safeway generic vanilla variety, which detracted from the experience a bit.   ALL IN ALL:  It's been a while since we last visited Burma Superstar and my memory isn't the clearest, but I think I could agree that this edges it out slightly, but not by much. However, Burma Superstar has to this day one of my favorite desserts ever, coconut ice cream & mango sorbet over warm prata. Shall we call it a truce?  

                "Ahhhh it hit the spot" was what my brother said after our meal here. This place is definitely a good place to go to for comfort Burmese food.   What was good? Tea leaf salad, for sure, although it is quite similar to the ones at other Burmese places. I'm not even sure you can mess this one up. The curries are delicious as well, the perfect complement to hot steaming rice. The Shan style fish and herbs was very delicious, and I think that's my favourite of it all.  We also got the yellow pea tempura -- which is more like a samosa -- and I guess this was the most disappointing dish. It's just not that flavourful on its own. I suppose it did come on a nice dish.  Overall I think I like this place. The atmosphere is decent, they have some booths that are more private, and the wait staff was nice even though they were a bit slow. With all the Burmese places opening up all over the bay area, I think this one is a keeper.  

                I am in love with their tea leaf salad. I usually call in and pick it up. Its the perfect mix of crunchy, spicy and flavorful. All the ingredients are separated in the to go box and you can just mix it up before you eat. I like this because it gives you a bit of control over how much of each ingredient you want in it. It also allows you to control the level of spiciness. There is a small pile of chopped chili, so if you don't like spicy food just be sure to leave that section out. I've never dined in so I can't speak to the experience- though the ambiance seems nice. Low lights, clean and quiet.  

                One of the nicer looking Burmese places I've been to. I think the AC was on, but I was still sweating a lot and even more when I started eating.  Free complimentary soup was a good idea since we were all starving. Light refreshing soup.  Foods: Fish noodle soup here is on the redder side and a little more oily, but still delicious!  Goat Curry was tender and flavorful.  Tea leaf salad was really good. Glad they added cabbage instead of lettuce. We had another chicken dish, but I wasn't into the chicken.  Price is more expensive than Kyain Kyain in Fremont. Service was ok since they were busy. They still let us get a table when they were close to closing time.  

                Great food. Must visit. They make  food in front of you. It's amazing different and cool location  

                I tried the goat stew, the tea leaf salad and the flat Burmese noodles based on people's reviews.  I also ordered the prata which was my favorite among the things I tried. We also ordered tea which we thought was free but was not (the server didn't understand us very well when we were ordering). The portions here are very small compared to other asian restaurants. Most dishes are around $9 each. The goat stew was my 2nd favorite dish followed by the noodles then the tea salad.   The salad came with nuts, one of which felt like a rock to me and was impossibly hard to chew. It was also very salty. The noodles were very wet and was also on the salty side. The stew was very yummy and the goat was very tender but the dish comes with a small amount of rice or prata. Additional prata is $1.50.   Service here was a little bit off. My group waited quite some time to get our check brought out to us. We had to go toward the kitchen area to get their attention after we waited for a long time for them to serve us. They only accept two credit cards maximum for each bill.   The restaurant is a medium size with private-ish booth areas that are separated from other booths by a screen. I liked the ambience but wish that the food wasn't as salty and that the portions were slightly larger. Compared to Burma Superstar the dishes weren't as sweet with was a plus.  

                I'm giving this place 5 stars because this really is the best Burmese food I've had in a restaurant, and extremely authentic.  This is good honest Burmese cooking, and I should know!  I grew up with this stuff.  Some of the dishes are national, others are regional.  Most dishes are flavorful and well balanced.  The salads are incredible.  Love the ginger salad.  Gotta get that one. The samosa is another favorite. Fish noodle soup, coconut chicken soup are the 2 national dishes and are both done well here. Its worth a visit!  

                Love this place for several reasons. Their fish chowder ( Mohingar ), 2 styles tea leaf salad, Shan noodle salad, appetizer shan tofu & Shwe Kyi dessert. Look like a japanese restaurant but they hav burmese speaking servers too. Pretty fast for to-go order whenever I'm in rush. I wish they do "Pork Ears salad" soon like Ko Jason noodle shop, so I won't have to go all d way to Fremont  

                WHY WE WENT HERE: - birthday dinner with the family  THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE): - easily overlooked in the plaza  THE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE): - clean - quaint  THE MENU: - salad - appetizer - vegetable - noodle - seafood - meat & veggie - extra - dessert  WHAT WE ORDERED: - tea leaf salad - samosa - Burmese chicken curry - roasted Cornish chicken - Burmese style beef stew - seik tar chet (goat stew) - rice - prata (flatbread) - sanwinmakin - hot tea  THE TASTE: - everything was so good we almost didn't have leftovers  CUSTOMER SERVICE: - prompt - polite - attentive - professional  

                I'll all about efficiency - or, well, okay, maybe I'm just really lazy when it comes to driving. In either case, I figured I'd make the most of my drive back up from SoCal by meeting up with an OkC date on my way through the South Bay, and Kyusu caught both of our eyes. We end up ordering their:  * Tea Leaf Salad - A must at any Burmese restaurant, and, surprisingly one of the tastiest ones I've ever had: far tastier than Burma Superstar's, and actually a bit more enjoyable than Mingalaba's as well, which was previously my favorite.  * Kawk Swe Thoke - I, personally, was a huge fan of this dish, which was almost curry-like in flavor. The overall dish was packed with a ton of flavor, and the noodles themselves had great texture. My date, on the other hand, wasn't as impressed, so take that as you will.  *Seik Tar Chet (Goat Stew) w/ Prata - My least favorite dish of the three. Not to say that it was bad though: it lacked the usual gaminess of goat, which was nice, but I still found the meat a little too tough, and the flavors a little... not lacking in intensity, but in complexity.  All in all though, a solid Burmese joint. Shame it's so far away from me!  ***Accessibility Info***  Venue - It was hard to get a sense for just how large the restaurant was, because all the tables were somewhat compartmentalized, which was nice for privacy, but made sitting at anything but the end of the table a little difficult, since the spaces between the dividers and table edges were a bit of a tight fit (but not impossible).  Bathroom - Didn't check them out, so no comment.  

                1. Good ambience. I like the booths. 2. Good and polite service. 3. Tea leaf salad is good as other reviews suggests. 4. Satisfied and worth the buck.  Bad: 1. Samosa is bad! Looked like frozen-fried stuff. 2. Highly limited vegetarian options.  

                My experience here could be summed up as "One shining star surrounded by  average stars."  I'll sound like a broken record as you read the other reviews, yes the Tea leaf salad is excellent, probably the crunchiest salad I've ever had.  We also ordered the coconut noodle soup and the aroma chicken.  The coconut soup was OK, but the noodles were well over done and had the texture as if they'd been sitting in the soup all night. The aroma chicken was good, although not crunchy and seemed like the sauce was missing a dimension. I'd get that salad any day of the week, maybe I'll come back to try some other things.  

                2/3/14 Came here around 1pm Wednesday with the boyfriend and was immediately seated. The restaurant is bigger than I thought it'd be and roomy between tables.   The food comes out super quick, right after we ordered the waitress came back out with a complimentary chicken soup. The soup had a little bit of a kick to it. Normally chicken soups don't have any trace of spice, but this one did.  5 minutes after she dropped off the soup, out came our tea leaf salad. They bring the salad with the toppings on different parts of the plate and then mix it at your table. Mmm I really liked the nuttiness of the salad. It gave it a nice crunch and flavor too it. **If you don't like peanuts I would avoid this one.**  Soon after, (like right after we divided the salad onto our plates) out came our flat Burmese noodles. This dish was also mixed at the table. What surprised me about this one was that it was not hot at all. They give you the entree at room temperature. I would have enjoyed it more if it was hot, but I guess that's just the way this dish is served.  Other than that, this dish was also very tasty!  Out total came out to be ~20$ for the salad and noodle dish. Also had some leftovers while sharing the dishes.  Service was great, as well as the food.  I would definitely recommend this place if you want to try out Burmese food. I think I like this place more than Burma superstar in SF :) Will come back!  Be aware that they close at 2PM and reopen later for dinner!  

                4.5 stars!   My absolute favorite Burmese restaurant in San Jose! The chicken noodle curry soup is just absolute heaven in a bowl! Whoever decided to combine the simple ingredients to go into that dish was a genius! It is hearty, creamy, warm and perfect for a cold day. I would take this noodle soup anyday over a bowl of ramen or pho. The noodle soup is a perfect balance of savory, spicy, citrus and other flavors that play with your tastebuds. My other standouts include the tea leaf salad, done original style and the nan gyi dok which is a rice noodle dish with light curry, cilantro, onions, chicken and other goodness.   The staff is soooo nice. They always say hi and make you feel happy when dining here. They would also explain to you about the dishes and its ingredients if you never had Burmese food. You won't be disappointed if you were to dine here. It is a no frills place without the high prices too! Check it out if you're in the area and expect a wait during peak dining hours.  

                I would give this place 3.5 stars. The food is good and the service is friendly. I would have given it more stars, if I hadn't eaten at Burma Superstar and realized how the food could be even better :) Bottom line, if you don't want to drive up to SFO and want pretty good Burmese food, Kyusu is the place to go :)  

                It's a good choice for burmese! Call in ahead for a reservation to avoid the long lines.  You gotta start out with the tea leaf salad. I've had it a few places, but this is the best of the bunch. Getting it with cabbage is the way to go, but you can also do lettuce if you feel like it.   For appetizer, I ordered the bayar gyaw, which is almost like a falaffel ball. Comes in like 9 pieces and two dipping sauces. It's okay.   For the vegetable section, I got the sauteed mustard greens which tasted like any other sauteed mustard greens. Would probably pass on this.   Entrees kauk swe thoke - comes with the noodles you would find in chow fun, mixed with a bunch of spices and oils like fish sauce, garlic oil, chili oil, and yellow pea powder. It's a complex dish and tasty.  fish soup noodle (mohingar) - It comes with rice vermicelli, catfish, hard boiled eggs, fried yellow peas and cilantro. It's like a thick soup with noodles. Super delicious.   Shan Style Fish - It's a braised tilapia in a clay pot. It is good with rice  Curry Aroma chicken - It tastes like popcorn chicken you get at Pearl tea houses. It was good, but if you're looking for something more interesting, you can probably pass on this.  Burmese style beef stew - Red beef curry with grass-fed beef. It comes with your choice of rice or prata. I got prata since some of the other dishes came with rice. The prata is buttery and nice. Goes well with the stew. Tender meat, good flavor.   If you're looking for a burmese place to try, give this one a shot.  

                Delicious Burmese Food; hence the 4.5 stars! :) One of the better Burmese restaurants I have been to, but definitely the first I have tried in the South Bay. We came here on a Friday night and surprisingly, it wasn't too packed. Parking is not too hard to find since it's located in a fairly large plaza. Kyusu is a bit hard to find, but it's located next to a few popular restaurants. Restaurant is a bit small and the waiting area is even smaller. But for a small restaurant, it's quite popular. We were seated in a booth area where we felt that we had a private section in the restaurant.   Food- Tea Leaf Salad: Comes with a mix of pickled Burmese Tea leaves, fried beans, fried garlic, peanuts, sesame seeds and premium sesame oil, dried shrimp, fresh tomato and fresh shredded lettuce. I think my favorite restaurant to go for Tea Leaf Salad would be Kyusu. Super flavorful with the different spices and tasty that it's not too acidic nor too overpowering. It's a very light salad and I love the kick to it when you mix in the hot red chilli. I love the crunch to it from the seeds. At first, we thought the portions were going to be small, but we were very wrong.   Burmese Style Beef Stew (Ametar Chet) - Known as the red beef curry. At first glance, it doesn't look that yummy, but don't judge a dish by how it looks! We ordered this with prata and it was quite addicting eating the prata with the curry. Yumm, but was very filling quickly. Beef was very tender and moist. Curry was a bit thick and chunky. However, it was a bit weird that it came with green peas.. The peas were just out of place..  Kauk Swe Thoke - Flat flour noodles served with onion and tomato based with chicken in a yellow pea powder. Pretty interesting dish as I have never tasted a yellow pea powder dish before. To be honest, I didn't really like this dish THAT much. I was a bit disappointed in the flavor and how it tasted. The dish was a bit creamy and the noodles were soft.  I'm pretty sure I will come back to Kyusu as I want to try more items from their menu! Service was great and the waiters are patient and helpful in explaining the dishes. Our water cups were always filled. You'll definitely feel welcomed at Kyusu. Plus, prices are decent and reasonable. :)  

                Tea leaf salad was good. Goat stew is good if you like sweet flavor. Portions are too small. Went in very hungry and left kind of hungry.  

                Came for lunch with co-workers cause i've been eying this place for a while. I live fairly close and whenever i drive by there's usually a line outside...so it must be a good sign. We got there around 11:40a and there was no line. Granted it's the week of New Years so i'm sure people are out of town. But either way worked for us. We got seated immediately.. I got the pork noodle soup (i'm not even going to try and recall the official name). My co-workers got the fish noodle soup, coconut noodle soup, Burmese stir fried noodles and the aroma chicken. Everyone raved about their food. The picker eater in our group walked out of there very pleased about her choice and has stated that this would be a go to place. Everyone got complimentary soup before their meal (cabbage and glass noodles, there may have been chicken or pork in it as well. I can't recall) The staff was friendly and tried their best to explain how to eat the soups (make sure to add lemon or chilli).  Very pleased that the yelp reviews were pretty accurate and my hunch about seeing outside waits, meaning good food, was right. This place is a must return. I have my eye on the coconut noodle soup and the Burmese cake. We will see if a follow-up will change my rating...but i'm pretty sure it won't if the first experience was well received by everyone in the group.
