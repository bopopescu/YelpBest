                Incredible!  Our dinner rivaled the finest restaurants I've been to from Paris to Hawaii to New York to San Francisco--and to find it in little Guerneville was a surprise. The ambience was great from the custom chandelier to the real oil candles, the lighting, to the white table clothes.   The steak melted in my mouth, the asparagus was perfect, my wife's lobster bisque seafood combination was exquisite. The bread pudding was fantastic. The service was perfect. We were so surprised. Five stars on all fronts. What a find.  

                sorry, but guess they're rating this place by sf standards if over two stars.  nice folks, neighborhood, city, etc.  food.....my sole was microwaved but very bearable.    anyway, trying hard with nice people.  

                Excellent food and service. I got the tomato mozzerella salad, nice size, could've split it with my bf but he's lactose intolerant.  He got the scampi and really liked it, except for the shrimp tail (it looked like more scallops than shrimp) that still had some of the shell and the whole tail on it. But he still thought it was really good.  I got the NY strip steak done just medium rare, perfectly cooked, great flavor. Came fast but not too fast. Our waitress was super nice. I told her we came from philly and she took the time to write out a bunch of places she recommended we check out while in town. That's great service, folks. :)  In sum, bangin food, great service. Fell short a star just cuz of the poorly peeled shrimp, it was kinda cold in the restaurant, and the music was oddly intense and dramatic at times. We'll come back again. :)  

                Absolute great French-cuisine without breaking the bank. Small, chic, elegant and clean inside. Must try the chefs special Lobster Bisque, best I have ever had! Awesome wine menu as well. Service is a tad slow & servers seem to forget what they are serving you after you order. Disappointed on the dessert menu, wish there was more they could offer in that category.  

                For my bachelorette party my sister made reservations at this resturant to have a nice evening little did we know that we were about to be attacked!! There were 10 Of us women that were seated next to the 2 table tops which maybe the restaurant should have planned better. We were enjoying our meal when the guy next to us came over and told us we were too loud and proceeded to call us a BITCHLERETTE party! When we informed our waiter he told us we were loud. I am sorry but there was a more polite way of handling this! I was offended that it's ok to talk to a group Of women and call them bitches if they are having a good time. Oh and by there was a screaming child in the restaurant and nobody called them a bad name!!! Horrible place!!!  

                This place was OK.... I probably would try somewhere else in town before going back here. The service was lacking. The wine and entrees were good but the tomato/mozzarella appetizer was not great- out of season hard tomatoes. I thought it was a little over priced for the ambiance, service and quality.  

                We were there for Valentine's Day. Everything was so delicious. I wish we could remember our servers name. He was awesome and the way he greeted guests that didn't have a reservation was so classy. We look forward to returning one day.  

                Awesome food and even better service. Our waiter was super friendly and super patient. We were a little tipsy but Colin was calm and waited for us to calm down and order lol. He recommended some amazing dishes and we left satisfied  

                Wanted to cap off my visit to this most hospitable area and town with what I deemed would be a great cuisine experience. Ordered the Surf and Turf special and crab cakes starter. My wifey ordered the same. Crab cakes were served. Plate was too large and too much salad and not enough crab cake. Seemed to be too much of the filling. Was OK. Surf and Turf came; lobster tail with steak covered with a merlot sauce. Steak was over cooked (they didn't ask how we wanted it cooked so well done it was--we like medium by the way). The Merlot sauce made it edible. Prior to this, my wifey's experience with lobster was Red Lobster and hadn't liked it since. But for this trip, she wanted to try something different and decided to venture. Now she REALLY doesn't like lobster. The food seemed rushed on high temperature. Wouldn't return. Sad, since we take part in two wineries so we will make trips up here four times a year. For the price, it was four times more costly and three times less enjoyable than Main Street Bistro.  

                Holy smokes! This place is freaking fantastic. Amazing service and beautifully presented outstanding food! Our server Colin was so sweet and attentive!  As for the atmosphere, it was splendid, warm with romantic lighting and they even had live music (a delightful man playing a beautiful Spanish acoustic guitar).   For appetizers, I had the spring mix salad with house made champagne vinegarette which was super delicious and my hubby had the spinach creme fraiche soup which was to die for! As for entrees; I had one of the specials, which was a seafood soup with scallops, salmon, prawns, and a white fish in a lemongrass and Sauvignon blanc broth and omfg it was dynamite!!! Complex array of flavors which harmonized perfectly with each ingredient! The seafood was plump and sooo juicy! My babe got the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken which was delicious as well.   To top it off, the chef Patrick came out to say hello and ask how we liked the food and brought us two complimentary glasses of port! So happy to find this place. Definetly will be coming back! A must if you are in the area :D  

                Went there for my boyfriend's birthday. Nice place. We had an order of crab cakes for $12.95. There were 2 small crab cakes that were just ok. My boyfriend had the New York Steak for $24.95. He liked it although he would have preferred less sauce on his steak. I had the Seafood bisque for $28.95 it was yummy. It had 2 prawns, 2 scallops and 2 pieces of salmon. I would have preferred one more prawn and scallop but the sauce was great. Both dishes came with vegetables and rice both done right. We shared a brownie for $10. With a beer the check came to $88.60 before tip. The reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the restaurant is a bit cool. They had a space heater next to our table which kind of took away from some of the ambience. My second comment is the floor tile throughout the restaurant is very slick to walk on.  

                We have been visiting the area this weekend for the Monte Rio Triathlon & wanted somewhere for 2 of our party of 6 to have our pre-race dinner. We wanted somewhere that served plain, easily digestible food for the 2 athletes but also was interesting for the others & a fun place for a get-together.   Chef Patrick's fit the bill perfectly. It's a great, big restaurant with loads of space & pleasantly buzzing with diners.   I didn't have very high expectations of he food, after reading previous reviews, but it was actually delicious, we all enjoyed our choices. For the record, these included crab cakes, tomato mozzarella salad, prawn cocktail as starters; main courses were New York steak, salmon special, special beef stew, seafood casserole & chicken & mash. We all appreciated our generous servings of vegetables too.   We had an odd problem, one of the dining plates suddenly cracked with a mighty bang all of its own accord! The staff handled that very smoothly & swiftly brought out a fresh plate of food.   We had a selection of dessert: bread pudding; creme brûlée; & a passionfruit trifle which was a real treat (I don't see much passionfruit on the menu nowadays & love it).   It's not fashionable, it's not posh, but there are crisp white tablecloths and simply good, fresh food.  

                Very good food, nice presentation and low-key romantic atmosphere. One of the consistently good restaurants in Guerneville.  

                Colin was a very friendly waiter who recommended a good wine (I know nothing of the wine lingo) and which food to pair it with, which made the decision process easy verses the normal headache.  Excellent food, I had the pork. And dessert was very very yummy!!  I will definitely recommend Chef Patrick's to people :).  

                Came here on a Saturday night.  The place is clean and modern.  There is a guitarist playing in the background.    We are a large group, and we ordered ahead.  I get filet with pinot sauce., mashed potatoes on the side, good.  Friends order salmon which was wonderful also with mashed on the side.  Nice clam chowder for a start.    Service was good considering we had a large group.  Drinks, apps, and steak and fish all came out in order.    Food*** Service**** décor****  

                A mixed story. My seafood stew was excellent, however my wife was disappointed with the filet mignon. Atmosphere was good and staff friendly.  

                Tempted by their posted menu, we strolled in for an early dinner, concerned that  1) we might be turned away for not having a reservation because although the night was young (5:30 or so) the place was quite busy 2) that we were underdressed in our shorts and t-shirts Fortunately for us there was a table for two available, and despite the chic interior most of the clientele was casually attired.  A. wanted the brussels sprouts which were sadly missing from their dinner menu, but our friendly waiter reported that the Chef agreed to make them for dinner just this once just for her.  I had the vegetarian capellini, and we started with the soup du jour which was a delicious garlicky green bean soup served chilled.  A bit on the pricey side, but all our dishes were lovely, and service was attentive.  Recommended for a nice dinner.  Reservations advisable.  

                Great food. It was late at night. We walked in close to 9 p.m on a Saturday after we crashed a hippie wedding down the street.  The food was great! I ordered the pesto cream pasta and my husband ordered the pork dish. Everything melted in our mouths. Served piping hot and so tasty! Delicious food!  My only complaint is that the bread that they served was fair and the place is in need of a new decorator.  Great Place!  

                My co-worker and I are eating our way through the area and had not been here for lunch yet. We went on a Thursday at noon and it was open. We got seated right away and the waitress was really nice.  The food was good (a little pricey for lunch) We had the Artichoke crab cake. It was really more of a casserole than a cake. The portion was on the smaller side and just right for lunch. The atmosphere is nice and quiet. Only 2 other tables.   I have been here for dinner when it first opened and the food was good then also.  If i want good service and a nice clean place right on the main drag in town , I will come back.   IF i am looking for more reasonable prices for lunch, I will probably look around elsewhere first.  

                Exquisite food. Nice menu choice. Most of all the price was decent for the type of food it was which is California/French cuisine. The waiter we had was very friendly and attentive. We go to Guerneville once a year and will absolutely make this one of our "to do's" when were there.  

                Ate here 3 times and enjoyed every meal and experience.  

                Went for the first time at the suggestion of a friend. It was our anniversary so we wanted something a little special. WOW what a wonderful evening we had, good food and good conversation with the love of my life. The special which was filet mignon with a shallot wine reduction and Brie was perfect. My wife had the freshly made lobster ravioli topped with Parmesan crusted prawns and was very happy. And you all know happy wife equals happy life ;). The appetizers where wonderful, crab cakes and prawn cocktail and for dessert, the double chocolate brownie Sunday with triple berries was out of this world. We used the spoon to get all that decadent sauce.   Do not miss this if you are in the area. It is great and relaxing.  

                My wife and I ate dinner here on a Sunday evening. We had the special which was filet mignon with a shallot wine reduction and Brie. This was served with a chilled tomato bisque soup which had a hint berry flavor to it. Both were extraordinary in taste and presentation. Steaks were cooked exactly as ordered, service was excellent and the atmosphere was quiet. We did dine early, about 5pm, so there were few in the restaurant with us.   Desserts were also delicious but those reviews are best left to my wife since she has a much more developed pallet in that field.  

                I was told by a few friends and locals that this was the best food in Guerneville.  Now I have not eaten at EVERY place in Guerneville, but it was VERY good.  And now looking at the pics, I now know Colin was our waiter. We had the crab cake appetizer, rock fish special and the pork tenderloins.  Everything was cooked damn-near perfect and the flavors were outstanding... And pretty reasonable considering.    Thanks folks you helped make it a great evening!  

                Terrible. Overpriced. No taste. Sucked. Waitress took forever. Mediocre menu. Was that supposed to be good bread they served us?  

                Wonderful food !!! Chef Patrick is amazing  

                We knew we wanted to eat with our California cousins somewhere along the Russian River while we were visiting.  But that proved more challenging on a Wednesday night than we expected.  Lucky for us, they drove around and checked out some places in person while we were sampling at nearby Korbel.  They'd made reservations, but we our stomachs were on East Coast time, so we decided to just eat early.  The staff informed us that there was a reservation for a large party, so they advised us to sit on the opposite side of the restaurant due to the noise.  The server advised us of the specials: sole with crab, scallops, and a third that I can't remember.  I chose the scallops and a green salad to start.  The green salad was lovely - such bright colors, fresh greens, and hardly any dressing (just the way I like it).  The scallops were good - a tad overcooked.  And the texture sun-dried tomatoes detracted more from the dish than I expected.  The cousins really enjoyed their sole with crab, and J ate every bit of his pork tenderloin.  All in all, a good, but not great meal.  I don't normally order dessert, but everyone else was, and I was on vacation, so I chose the bread pudding that is a house specialty.  Overall, it was a tad mushy and a tad to sticky sweet for me, but I'm not a bread pudding aficionado.  The restaurant itself was a tad warm, but they had fans and portable AC units running to cool it off.  The service was friendly and helpful, making it feel very homey.  Nice spot for a good dinner in Russian River.  

                Tried the fettuccine, the chicken confit d'onions, it was very good and nice mise en place. Service is nice and quaint. Meat is local and seasonal dishes.  

                Chef Patrick's is an gem.   We had our rehearsal dinner there on a Thursday with 15 people.  Every Single One of Us - every one - loved the appetizer, entree and desserts.   There was not a single miss.   So much so, that we ALL went back on Sunday night and had an equally flawless meal.   And Chef Patrick himself came to the table both times and was incredibly friendly and charming.   Do not miss Chef Patrick's!!!  

                Exquisite seafood dishes, including parmesan crusted wild king salmon and a seafood medley, paired beautifully with a local chardonnay displaying wood, butter, acid, fruit and mineral, in balance.  

                Superb food! I had the seafood trio Wooow it blew my taste buds. And their bread pudding left me speechless, the best one I had in my entire life. Definitely I will recommend their food. The service was great and love their decor, small details that enhanced the ambiance and the music playlist perfect.  

                Don't be fooled by the interior or the fact that it appears to be empty.    Come here and you'll be happy you did. This is big city flavor in a local scene.  Best caesar salad ever. Order it with easy dressing, however.  Filet amazing: lightly crispy and perfectly cooked inside. Nancy was great server. Came on a 2nd night and had the Pork dish.  Pretty awesome too.  Don't half step. Even if you get swooned by the cool logo and name of the place across the street, stop here for a dinner one night.  You'll be glad you did.  

                Highly recommend!!  

                We've eaten at Chef Patrick several times, and every time it's 100% consistently good. The red wine reduction chicken is to die for, and the South Asian stew with lemongrass is simply delicious.  Also a yummy filet mignon.  The service is friendly and warm, never fussy or pretentious. Definitely the one of the best dinners in the Russian River area, and reasonably priced,  

                Discovered Patrick's last year and ate there several times.   Went back last night and wasn't disappointed.   Excellent soups, my dinner mate and I both got the specials.   They are great for large parties.   The bread pudding is delicious.   Last year the chef came to our table several times to make sure exerting wad ok.   The only big negative is their A/C isn't great.  

                In a word, WOW for both the negative reviews and how I feel about the place.  I haven't been there in colder months so can't attest for room temperature but have been twice in March and found it pleasant.  The service both times was xlnt and the food is SUPERB.   Chef Patrick served us off-menu duck confit.  I'm not much for duck but it was outstanding-it paired really well with the sauce and cabbage.  My Cesar salad was French style, my friend had the seafood "stew" which was out of this world.  Another friend kept going on and on about the balsamic-vinegar reduction sauce.  No one had ANY leftovers; we were all like little kids sopping up our plates with the bread. Any restaurant can and does have off-nights, but I find this place superb and will always go back every time I'm in town I put it at four stars for the single rest room and the wine list, which in Sonoma could be larger.  

                My boyfriend and I went here for our 3 year anniversary and I would have to say I have never tasted such divine food such as the filet mignon that I ordered. My boyfriend had the crab cakes and Salmon and told me it was the best food he has ever tasted. The atmosphere was comfortable and the waitress was very  helpful and kind. The Chef even gave us complimentary champagne to celebrate our anniversary.  It's Expensive food but well worth it.  

                Went for a girls dinner and apparently we were talking loud . Instead of politely being asked to quiet down they rudely comped the other table's dinners. We politely told the waiter that the next table over was very rude to us, the waiter told us "well you are being loud". The waiter was extremely rude! Management was very patronizing . The food was mediocre . I will not return . Not worth the price , all sides tasted frozen not fresh.  

                We reserved Chef Patrick's for a 25 person dinner, celebrating my partner's 50th birthday. Patrick was more than accomodating. We popped in to say hello two nights before the event, as we were in town for several days. I just wanted to introduce myself and remind him we were coming in a few days for the event. He invited us in for a complimentary glass of wine and to ask us what kind of food we might like. I noted that we had one vegetarian and one vegan in our group and he said "no problem."    The food was fantastic. Despite the large group, he offered his normal menu and even added a few specials - an Ono dish to die for and also a Filet Mignon - mouth watering. Our vegan was delighted with the gourmet vegetable dish that Patrick prepared.   The restaurant is large and open, but intimate with low lighting. Although the other restaurants on Main Street offer fine food, Chef Patrick's is a large and attractive space that can accomodate larger groups.  The service staff were magnificent; and had no problem juggling the needs of our loud and rambunctious group.  Classy joint - staffed by pros with an authentic, trained and talented chef in the kitchen.  

                Came here for dinner.  It was freezing inside; they had space heaters on to warm up the restaurant.  The best part of my meal was the soup, sweet pea.  That was delicious! The other food that we ordered was just ok; it  could have used a little more seasoning.  The crab cakes were cold in the center and the mash potatoes tasted like instant mash potatoes.
